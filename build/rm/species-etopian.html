        <p>An Etopian year is equivalent to about two Earth years. They have ten months and split down into ten day weeks, with five weeks in each month. Leadership is passed down in families unless a family is shamed then the next highest family takes over the leadership. Every ten earth years the Tribal leaders of each nation pick one amongst them to be the nation leader. These Nation leaders then pick the World Leader.</p>
        <p>The Economy is based on the free market but all members of society are expected to pay a tithe of all earnings to their tribal leader. If a nation decides that more money is needed then the tribal leaders are ordered to collect extra tithes. For example the colonisation projects were paid for with extra tithes from all the nations. The nations were then entitled to put forward their share of colonists for the program. When the moons were turned into the industrial centres for Etopos each nation was given responsibility for a share of the development. In return each nation receives a share of the income.</p>
        <p>When the colonies were formed on Mustine and Trexite a similar arrangement was set up. All the nations supported the colonies for the first one hundred earth years. After this the colonies were declared independent and left to their own devices. Most Etopians live a simple life, farming and gardening are common forms of employment. Many are skilled in agro sciences, others specialise in terraforming. Those without greenfingers tend to find their way to the moons.</p>
        <p>Etopos exports many foodstuffs, famous for the Etopian Mallow fruits, highly prized as they are not only delicious but very difficult to transport without ruining their delicate flavour and texture. All Etopians are guaranteed to receive an education, medical care, shelter and food. In return they pay their tithes. Although the standard that must be provided by the Tribal leader is not stipulated, therefore it is generally in people's better interests to work to provide better for themselves and their families. The World Government tries to ensure that certain basic levels of education and health care are maintained.</p>

        <p>Etopos was founded on a feudal system. Tribal leaders formed into nations and from there became a World Government. The process from warring tribes to a World Government took many centuries and many bloody wars. But had settled to the modern and fairly peaceful system by the Etopians equivalent of the twentieth century. Hence they never experienced an World Wars. Farming was an easy task on Etopos, very rarely will a plant struggle. Those who didn't farm the land farmed the seas. The only problem that drove farmers to become creative was the weather on Etopos. Hence Etopian Scientists developed methods of controlling the weather early on in their industrial age.</p>
        <p>Etopian biology was also far in advance of earth's of a similar era. The desire to protect their planet from the ravages of industry were spotted much earlier on Etopos than on Earth but the method they came up with took longer to develop. Having concentrated more on the bio sciences, it took a few extra years to firstly catch up on the physical sciences and then come up with methods that would cause least damage to their planet. In the end the desire to move heavy industry off the planet and the need to place weather control satellites in space forced the Etopians into a Space Age.</p>
        <p>Then a desire to not overcrowd their planet encouraged the nations to fund programs exploring space and developing the colonisation program. From there the discovery of warp quickly followed with the desire to travel between the first colony and the Homeworld more rapidly. Shortly after their discovery of Warp the Federation made first contact and Etopos joined the Federation. For the Etopian's planet history see Etopos Planet entry.</p>
        <p>TREXITE COLONY- Unlike their Homeworld Etopos, Trexite has had to keep their industry on planet. But following the lead of the Homeworld they have ensured that it does not affect their natural environment. One trick was to move some of the industry into the domed cities as the people moved out. The people of Trexite refer to themselves as Trexans. Their economic and political systems are very similar in nature to those of the Homeworld. Being close to the Homeworld has meant that strong ties have remained between the two worlds. Trade between the two planets continues and benefits both planets.</p>
        <p>MUSTINE COLONY- Mustine has not faired so well. Partly due to fewer people choosing to move to the planet and partly due to problems of ill health that have beset the colonists. In the beginning whilst living in the domes the colonists did not fair so badly but on moving outside poor health became a norm. Crops struggled to thrive and with the colonists poor health it was difficult to develop as quickly as Trexite had. During the first hundred years when Etopos supported the colony these problems were offset by supplies and services from the Homeworld. But since independence was declared the colony has been struggling. Etopian scientists have declared that the health problems are related to something on the planet but cannot yet define what. Teams were sent to investigate but since independence the Mustines have been left to their own devices. Contact between the Homeworld and Mustine has been very limited since independence and there is much bad feeling.</p>
