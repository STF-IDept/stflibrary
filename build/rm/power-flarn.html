        <p>The Flarn Regime is barely considered a power. It consists of a single planet, the Flarn homeworld of Flick, along with several small military and mining garrison colonies. It is located in the Alpha Quadrant, several light-years from the Federation colony of Pilton.</p>
        <p>The Flarn are technologically inferior to the Federation in almost every capacity, save military. The Flarn have devoted the vast majority of their history to the art of war, usually against each other, and as a result have developed highly advanced destructive machinery. As they are new to space exploration, their warp technology is considerably behind that of other major powers.</p>
        <p>A Flarn Heavy Cruiser is about the size of a Constitution-class vessel, but shaped more like a bumpy wedge. It has dense ablative armor, reinforced adaptive shielding, plasma rockets, quantum torpedoes, multi-phasic disrupters, and antimatter countermeasures. It is unusually maneuverable for a ship its size. Its maximum speed is warp 3.1.</p>
        <p>The most common Flarn vessel is the Flarn Streamer. Smaller and lighter than a Heavy Cruiser, it still possesses considerable firepower for its size. Plasma rockets, photon torpedoes, and multiple disruptor banks provide offensive power, while adaptive shielding protects the vessel itself. It has a maximum observed velocity of warp 2.4.</p>
        <p>The Flarn currently lack transporter and replicator technology. All Starfleet vessels are instructed to obey the Prime Directive religiously in order to keep it that way.</p>

        <p>When the Flarn race was finally unified under a single military leadership in 2343, they had only just developed space travel. Having no further enemies at home, they quickly developed interstellar travel in the hopes of finding new territory to conquer. With ships operating at only slightly more than the speed of light, it took them a while to establish any meaningful presence outside of their own system.</p>
        <p>First contact with the Flarn came in 2370, when a pair of Flarn scout ships attacked the Starfleet cruiser Debian. The Debian was easily able to outrun the attacking vessels, but only after suffering heavy damage. The Federation was mildly concerned about this new hostile race, but the Flarn leadership was ecstatic at the thought of someone else to conquer. After a series of brief skirmishes with a task force led by the Nimitz-class USS Arleigh Burke and Trafalgar-class USS Lexington, however, the Flarn realized that assaulting the Federation would prove somewhat more difficult than they originally expected, and they decided to further entrench themselves within their own small territory before making an outright assault.</p>
        <p>In 2373, the Federation decided to better protect itself against this new aggressor. The nearest Federation colony was the outlying world of Pilton, populated by strongly independent colonists, mostly human. Starfleet decided to construct a new starbase in orbit to serve as a first line of defense against the Flarn, as well as a base of operations. The new Outpost 45 would complement the center of Fleet Two operations, Starbase 93. Many on Pilton were not wild about the idea, however, as they valued their independence from the Federation proper.</p>
        <p>The Flarn learned of the growing tension between Pilton and the Federation, and sought to exploit it, to sabotage the construction effort. In 2374, they secretly contacted Pilton-based Yankovic Heavy Industries and attempted to bribe them into helping sabotage the Pilton-Federation relationship. Yankovic's executives agreed, and the plan went forward, but was thwarted by Starfleet in 2375, just as construction on Outpost 45 was completed. The USS Arleigh Burke was destroyed in the process, and the vessel's surviving command staff and crew were transferred to the station to take command. The Flarn have been relatively quiet since the Piltonian Insurrection.</p>
