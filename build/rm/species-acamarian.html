        <p>The Acamarians appear to be exactly like humans with the exception of a facial cleft in their foreheads. They are also known to have decorative facial tattooing. The Acamarians blood is unique, composed of an iron and copper composite. This allowed Dr. Beverley Crusher of the USS Enterprise-D to easily identify a blood sample she discovered on away team mission.</p>

        <p>Centuries ago, the Acamarians were a savage and violent race due to the fact that they were split into social and political clans. These clans were the primary cause of many blood feuds and hatred among the race that often lasted for generations. There was one such violent feud between the Lornaks and Tralestas that lasted three centuries which ended when the last Tralesta died. However, there were three survivors of the Tralesta clan that survived the massacred in 2286 by the Lornak clan. These three members hide their identities well and choose one of these remaining members to extract revenge on the Lornak clan. A young girl named Yuta was chosen to be the assassin for clan Tralesta. (See below for more information about Yuta.)</p>
        <p>About one century ago, the Acamarians ended all blood feuds. A group left to become interstellar marauders and called themselves the Gatherers when all the blood feuds were ended. Since then, the Acamarians have enjoyed a century of peace. However, the Gatherers have been the only disruption of peace for the Acamarians. The Gatherers are responsible of many raids in neighboring outposts and sectors around the Acamar system. Captain Picard went to visit the Acamar system on Stardate 43421.9 (in the year 2366) in an effort to stop Gatherer raids with Sovereign Marouk, the head of the Acamarian government at that time.</p>
        <p>Sovereign Marouk brought aboard two aides on to the Enterprise. One of these was a chef and food taster that happens to be Yuta. She appeared to be a woman in her late twenties; however her body had been altered to dramatically reduce her rate of aging so that she could exact revenge against the Lornak clan. Her body was infused with a genetically engineered microvirus that was harmless to all except members of the Lornak clan. But that was not discovered by the Enterprise crew, and this microvirus did not pick up on the Enterprise's transporter filter or scanners. Because she appeared to be in her late twenties, Commander Riker developed a romantic interest in Yuta.</p>
        <p>The Enterprise had set a course for the Hromi Cluster, a stellar group, where it was believed a Gatherer base camp might be located. At the time, it was an uncharted area to the Federation, despite it was near the Acamar system. This cluster is home to many systems and planets, including Gamma Hromi II. Gamma Hromi II is where Captain Picard met Brull, a Gatherer pack leader. Sovereign Marouk and Captain Picard were able to convince Brull to allow Sovereign Marouk and Captain Picard to talk to the leader of the Gatherers, Chorgan. Brull gave the Enterprise the coordinates to the ship where Chorgan was on. Shortly after Brull agreed, an elderly Gather named Volnoth died. Dr. Crusher appeared on the scene to investigate and to see if anything could be done for the elderly Gatherer. Volnoth was a member of the clan Lornak. Dr. Crusher discovered that he died of cardiac arrest. However, Dr. Crusher was unsure of the cause of the death, because his cardiac muscle was still strong based on her tricorder readings. Volnoth's body, along with Brull, Sovereign Marouk and the rest of the away team were brought back up to the Enterprise.</p>
        <p>On the way Chorgan's hideout, Commander Riker visits Yuta in her personal guest quarters, who says that she wants freedom but is already on a set path that she can not stray from. Adding to Yuta's mystery, Riker learns that she serves Marouk not by command, but by choice.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Dr. Crusher discovers in sickbay a microvirus in Volnoth's body. The tricorder scan had almost missed the microvirus. She called Commander Riker about the microvirus, describing it as a specific microvirus designed to kill one in one millionth of an Acamarian. Due to Dr. Crusher's searching through the Acamar medical database, she discovered that a Gatherer named Penthor-Mul died of the same microvirus 53 years ago.</p>
        <p>When the Enterprise arrived at the designated coordinates, Chorgan was unwilling to listen or answer any hails. The Enterprise launched a minor attack on Chorgan's ship, just enough to disable the shields. Captain Picard, Sovereign Marouk, Brull, and Yuta then beamed over to Chorgan's ship to discuss an end to all the hostilities of the Gatherers. On the Bridge of the Enterprise, a discovery of a photo in the databanks of the Acamarians allowed Dr. Crusher, Lt. Commander Data and Commander Riker to linked Yuta to the murder of Volnoth and Penthor-Mul. Another quick search by Data found that Chorgan was the remaining member of the clan Lornak. Upon this discovery, Commander Riker had to unfortunately kill her to prevent her from assassinating Chorgan. This was very difficult for Commander Riker; however Yuta did not stop when Riker asked. The conference ended successfully, despite the attempted assassination of Chorgan, which the Gatherers were given some land on Acamar to start a new life and end their wandering.</p>
