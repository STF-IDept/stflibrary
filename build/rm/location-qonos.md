Overview {.title}
--------

Qo'noS is located in Klingon space in the Beta Quadrant and is the
capital planet of the Empire. From space it is seen as a large green
world. It consists of a large landmass which is dominated by a vast
ocean. Qo'noS tilts on it's axis, which gives a range of climates and
temperatures, and gives rise to extremes of both hot and freezing
weather. Like earth it is a few degrees cooler at the poles. The Capital
of Qo'noS is First City, where the Great Hall is located. This is a
ceremonial building, which dominates the skyline. The Great Hall
functions both as a parliament, and as a supreme court. It is the seat
of Klingon Government. It's architecture reflects the Empire's military
style, and the structures give the appearance of enormous fortresses.

### Places of Interest {.title}

-   A mountain on Qo'noS where legend tells that Kahless the
    Unforgettable forged the first bat'leth by dropping a lock of his
    hair into the lava.
-   A lake on Qo'noS. History says that it was here that Kahless the
    Unforgettable finished forging the bat'leth. He dropped the burning
    lock into the water, and twisted it to make a blade.
-   A province or region of Qo'noS, where Lady Grilka comes from.
-   Subterranean chambers which are often used in the Day of Honor
    ritual, where participants are required to drink mot'loch.
-   The city that was destroyed by Emperor Sompek. Around 10,000 of
    Sompek's warriors laid seige to the city, before it finally
    surrendered. Sompek then ordered the city burned and the occupants
    killed.
-   Another ancient city. It was here that a great storm struck, whilst
    Kahless the Unforgettable was visiting. One warrior went outside to
    face the storm in order to 'stand before the storm and make it
    respect him'. He was instead killed. Kahless later commented, 'The
    wind does not respect a fool'.

History {.title}
-------

The planet was seeded with life 4 billion years ago, along with Earth,
Vulcan and Cardassia to name a few. In 2293, Qo'noS suffered severe
environmental damage when Praxis, their key energy producing facility at
the time suffered a catastrophic explosion that ended up shattering the
moon, leaving only a small fragment behind. It was estimated that Qo'noS
would have used up all of it's oxygen within 50 years, if resources were
not spent into rectifying the problem. The Klingon Empire needed to
reroute it's financial spending, and could no longer afford it's
military campaign with the Federation. It was this key event that led to
the peace initiative that was undertaken by Gorkon, then Chancellor of
the Empire.
