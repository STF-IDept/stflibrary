        <p>The Flea'tan Alliance is relatively small, spanning only twenty large colony systems, with a star ship navy of about 250 active vessels. In the Flea'tan monarchy a queen is raised from within their society every 150 years. Males hold an equal standing in the navy and other jobs however they cannot hold positions in government.</p>

        <p>Early 2128 - Flea'tan society achieves in-system spaceflight.</p>
        <p>Mid 2128 - Flea'tan scientists discover an alien structure at the edge of their solar system; research begins on new technology discovered there.</p>
        <p>2130 - Flea'tan scientists discover the alien structure is in fact a means of faster than light travel that is connected to other relay 'jump points'. They had to figure out how to get the jump points to work though. After two months of hard work they created many compression relay antennas that they soon expanded to work with other alien jump points in nearby systems. Using these structures though limits their expansion into deeper unexplored space.</p>
        <p>2200 - The Flea'tan Alliance establishes its 5th colony outside the home Fleatara system called Andol'tara</p>
        <p>2239 - Males in Flea'tan society begin to push for more equality; their struggle for equal rights would take another 120 years.</p>
        <p>2290 - The Flea'tan Alliance establishes its 10th colony outside the home Fleatara system called Rol'tara</p>
        <p>2315 - Flea'tan scientists make their first major breakthrough in weapon and shield technology in over 185 years. Weapons are based on phased and photonic principles. Shields now form an encompassing bubble around a vessel instead of energizing along the hull.</p>
        <p>2320 - The Flea'tan Alliance creates a new division in their navy that they name 'Expansion Department 7'. The division's goals are locating new compression relay jump systems and developing new technologies.</p>
        <p>2325 - As part of Expansion Department 7's efforts relay energy battery cores are invented and soon stored upon all Flea'tan vessels, allowing limited conventional warp travel of Warp 3.5, for up to three weeks outside a relay jump system.</p>
        <p>2350 - The Flea'tan Alliance crowns its newest Queen from the Del'eck family tree. The 15th colony outside the home Fleatara system is named Del'eck to commemorate the occasion.</p>
        <p>2365 - Expansion Department 7's Commander Sal'esh Flea'tell is promoted to First Contact Captain, the first male to hold the title. With his duties of expanding the Flea'tan Alliance he has the added duty of being ambassador to any outside alien races. He is given this position due to the high risks of contact to possible alien races because of the nature of the jump relays. With these goals in mind he renews shipbuilding programs to bolster expansion and locate more relay jump hub systems and hopefully fashion new technologies.</p>
        <p>2368 - Sal'esh Flea'tell's effort at inventing new technologies bears fruit in a highly advanced sensor system that rivals present Federation technology by 10-15 years. In addition higher capacity relay battery cores are invented, allowing a cruising speed of warp 4.5 and a maximum speed of warp 6, for 12 hours for exploration purposes.</p>
        <p>2369 - Sal'esh Flea'tell begins the first of 9 expeditions, to seek out new resources and colonization systems for the Alliance. Each expansion brings him increased fame and funding.</p>
        <p>2374 - During Sal'esh Flea'tell's 5th expedition into deep space, on a highly converted exploration vessel, Sal'esh and his team discover what would soon become the 20th colony established by the Alliance called Flea'tell'tara. It is named after Sal'esh's family. He becomes the first male to have such a system named after him by the present Alliance Queen.</p>
        <p>Early 2386 - During Sal'esh Flea'tell's 9th expedition into deep unexplored space he encounters the Federation science ship USS Barrett, commanded by Andorian Captain Reen. A month after extensive cultural exchange, official first contact overtures are extended by the Federation. The Flea'tan's accept the offer showing interest in a technological exchange. The Federation wish to see the Flea'tan's advanced sensors and the Alliance wish to incorporate conventional warp cores into their vessels. Two weeks later the USS Crusader is sent to carry out the first meeting and technology exchange. After an exhaustive 2 months of co-operation to stop the return of the Elder race, the mission ends in success and an official alliance between the Federation and Flea'tan Alliance is formed. An official technological and cultural exchange programs begin. Furthermore, the Crusader crew is heralded as honorary Knights of the Flea'tan Alliance at the crowning of the Queen for their efforts. Furthermore, during this time the USS Europa is sent on a top secret mission into Flea'tan space. Their mission entails stopping a renegade trio of Starfleet intelligence agents from Section 31, that have stolen a prototype stealth frigate equipped with advanced weapons and an interphase cloak. After an exhaustive month of searching, and a high pressure hide and seek game in a nearby colony system the Europa stops the attempted attack by the rogue intel agents from destroying the colony. As with the Crusader the entire crew is heralded as honorary Knights of the Flea'tan Alliance. With the securing of this technology exchange several Flea'tan Alliance engineers join the Federation in new shipbuilding projects; similarly Federation engineers join the Flea'tan Alliance in integrating conventional warp cores into their ships.</p>
        <p>Early 2387 - During these early months the USS Europa, USS Dresden and the prototype starship NX-Memorial are sent on a top secret mission into the areas between the Federation and Flea'tan Alliance to investigate missing colony reports. Their investigations find that the Elder and Ancients are waging a private war between each other, each race attempting to gain resources and effect changes in the timeline to be more favorable to their views. During one such investigation point the three ships aided by several Flea'tan cruisers learn of a missing colony where their Queen was currently visiting. Investigations reveal that the Elder in force has attacked and was harvesting the colony. At the same time several Ancient ships were converging for battle into the system through the Jump Relay. In a desperate move to avoid being destroyed, to save the colony and Flea'tan Queen and to stop further fights between the two races, the three Federation ships, led by Captain Dvorak of the USS Europa, formulate a plan to quickly use the three ship's tractor beams to slam a massive rogue comet into the relay. The resulting explosion destroys the Ancient ships, intercepting Elder ships and saves much of the colony and Flea'tan Queen. However, from the vantage point of the Flea'tan Alliance the three ships are seemingly destroyed as well in the resulting explosion.</p>
