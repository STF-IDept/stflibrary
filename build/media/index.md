**About this book**

STF has had numerous independent newspapers, newsletters, and other
media agencies throughout the years. Some have been serious, most at
least slightly humorous.

Many of these publications were managed off-server, and as a result some
have been lost. Others were kept on-server, and are still available for
the amature historian in search of a laugh. They are presented below
more or less chronologically.
