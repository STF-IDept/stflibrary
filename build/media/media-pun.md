About Plumbers United Network {.title}
-----------------------------

Also known as Aye on the WeBB, take 2, PUN was another of the
single-issue publications from the Golden Age of Media. After the Aye on
the WeBB debacle, Hughes dropped out of journalism for a few months but
returned shortly after the election of Bob Spurlin with a new paper,
deliberately satirizing the "United Paramount Network", the new network
from Star Trek's parent company. It's single issue contained little in
the way of news, consisting mostly of random humor and featurettes,
although it did include an interview with former STF President Jim
Midyette during one of his brief reappearances.

The Librarian recommends that users highlight the text on the PUN site
in order to view it all, as much of it is white-on-white.
