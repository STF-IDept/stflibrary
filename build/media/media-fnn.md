About Federation News Network {.title}
-----------------------------

The Federation News Network, or FNN, was another of the one-hit-wonders
that appeared and disappeared around the election of Bob Spurlin.
Published by just-returned-from-AWOL Randy McCullick, FNN's one short
issue was a sort of "SNN UPDATE-lite", mixing gossip with short
satirical news.

FNN's primary contribution to STF Media history, actually, was its
scandal. At the time, SNN had the informal agreement of the various
Fleet Commanders to post announcements of new issues of WeBBsights in an
SNN-designated section of each fleet's MOTD. McCullick, however, chose
to announce FNN's first issue on fleet MOTDs as well without the
permission of the Fleet Commanders, which incensed several of them. The
resulting complaints, arguments, and debates led to the creation of the
Media MOTD, a new section on the login page just below the "Main MOTD".

While the Main MOTD is only editable by those with direct shell access
and was generally used for major system announcements, the Media MOTD,
while visually not distinguishable, was editable from the WeBB by a
select few with hard-coded access in effWeBB itself. Any media
organization could get a section in the Media MOTD to announce its new
issues by request. Ironically, the need for the Media MOTD to support
actual media fell by the wayside very quickly as most of the new media
outlets folded and it became the new location for SNN announcements as
well as seasonal content such as the Election Toteboard, which was also
managed by SNN.

Years later, after most STF news media had died off, the Media MOTD
would be co-opted by the government as an easier and more verbose way to
make club announcements than the Main MOTD. The name, however, and the
hacky-sloppy coding to support it, remained.
