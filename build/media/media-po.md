About Project Omega {.title}
-------------------

A relatively long-lived publication as STF news media go, Project Omega
ran from 2001-2002 under the leadership of Mike Rouse-Deane. Beginning
life as a semi-serious news and editorial source, Project Omega followed
in the footsteps of Galactic Independent News by breaking content out in
to multiple pages per issue. It also featured STF's first and so far
only comic strip featuring charicatures of STF members. It would feature
several writers both regular and guest during its run, including Chris
Healey, Alex Verdusco, Eddie Lawson, and others.

Unfortunately, Project Omega quickly ran into controversy. While mixing
news and editorial content is hardly new in STF media history, it
generally included a fair dose of humor and satire. It was also,
usually, clear which was which. Project Omega lost that distinction, and
many articles declined into editorials masquerading as news and personal
attacks against other members. STF had also changed by this point, and
had lost much of its playful whimsy. Many members took offense at
articles appearing in Project Omega, both legitimately and not, and
Rouse-Deane even received an official warning for harrassment in Edict
[Robison \#9](http://www.star-fleet.com/prez/robison.php3#e9).

The final straw came during the summer 2002 elections. Eddie Lawson,
then a columnist for Project Omega, had a running blog-like column
entitled "Eddie's Election Diary". However, he quickly used it to make
inappropriate comments about Election Coordinator Deanne Ashton and lame
duck President Larry Garfield, likening them to Hitler, Goebels, and
other leaders of the Nazi Party for the unusually strict enforcement of
election rules during that Election Season. Garfield ruled such behavior
to be in violation of STF's Terms of Service and unable to use Freedom
of the Press as protection, and ordered Project Omega banned from all
STF advertising of any form in Edict [Garfield
\#20](http://www.star-fleet.com/prez/garfield.php3#e20), effectively
killing the paper. An offer for the ban to be lifted in exchange for an
apology was never taken by Rouse-Deane, and Project Omega quickly faded.

Project Omega was hosted off-site, and no copies are currently
available.
