        <p>The Vice Commandant shall be appointed by the Academy Commandant. The Vice Commandant answers directly to the Academy Commandant, and is responsible for departmental decisions in the event the Academy Commandant is not available. Additional responsibilities are at the discretion of the Academy Commandant.</p>
        <p>The Academy Commandant and the Vice Commandant must have had three months Academy experience (excluding time served as a cadet), preferably as a Commanding Officer or Executive Officer on an Academy Ship.</p>

        <p>New members may request to join an Academy Training Ships when joining STF. The Personnel Department is required to honour department and posting speed choices, if possible, and allocate them evenly throughout the fleet. If the department and posting speed choices cannot be honoured, the new member will be placed on a mainstream ship. The Academy Commandant is to be informed if a member was unable to be placed.</p>
        <p>Current members on mainstream ships may also request to join the Academy. In this case, admission is dependent on the judgment of the member's Commanding Officers and Academy Commandant. They are to assess whether the member is struggling and whether he would benefit from Academy training. If a member does join the Academy in this manner, he must drop all of his mainstream ships. No member can be forced to join the Academy.</p>

        <p>  There are three ways a Cadet can leave the Academy Fleet.</p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <p>At the end of each mission, Cadets who have served an appropriate amount of time will be promoted to the rank of Ensign, and positions will be found for them on mainstream ships. The Academy will provide support to Cadets who are deemed to be needing it, and will notify the ships CO on areas the Cadet is weak in. Cadets who have exceeded expectations may be asked to stay on board the Academy ships as Lt (j.g.) Department Heads.
    </p>
          <p>The Academy Commandant, in discussion with a Cadet's CO, may choose to graduate the Cadet prior to the end of the mission. In these cases, the Cadet will be granted all the rights and privileges of a regular end-of-mission graduation.</p>
          <p>Cadets that request to leave the Academy prior to graduation are required to wait 120 days before they can be promoted from Ensign. In the event that a Cadet should leave the Academy early, his name will be placed on a list maintained by the Academy stating the exact date that the Cadet is eligible for rank promotion; this includes any Cadets that AWOL. All COs are requested to keep themselves familiar with this list. The Academy Commandant is responsible for contacting the CO of the ship that the Cadet went to when he originally left the Academy, and providing the CO with this information as well.</p>
          <p>In the case of AWOL Cadets, should they return to STF, the Academy Commandant may allow them to re-enter the Academy training program on a case by case basis. There is no guarantee, however, that they will be placed in the same department or on the same ship.</p>
          <p>Serving on any training ship is optional. Cadets who join the Academy program, thinking that it is mandatory, may approach the Academy Commandant and request to be transferred to a mainstream ship, provided they do so immediately upon finding out that the Academy is not mandatory. The Academy Commandant is required to give such requests due consideration. Upon the Academy Commandant's approval, the Cadet may be found a place on a mainstream ship as an Ensign, with all the rights and privileges that a new member, who is placed on a mainstream ship, has.</p>
          <p>Any other reasons for early departure are to be reviewed by the Academy Commandant and Vice Commandant on a case by case basis.</p>
          <p>The Academy Commandant, in discussion with a Cadet's CO, may remove a Cadet from the Academy program, and find a place for the Cadet on a mainstream ship at the rank of Ensign. The CO and XO of the mainstream ship will be notified of the circumstances surrounding the Cadet's removal. If deemed appropriate by the Academy Commandant, the President may also be informed.</p>
