Establishment of the Experimental Fleet {.title}
---------------------------------------

This bylaw establishes the Experimental Fleet, otherwise known as
X-Fleet. X-Fleet is a collection of Experimental Ships, otherwise
referred to as X-Ships. X-Fleet is administered by the Supervisor of
Experiments, or SOX.

The purpose of X-Fleet is to provide an area for members to try out new
ideas under a set of clear and simple rules, with the ultimate aim of
improving the club as a whole. How lessons learned from X-Fleet shall be
applied to the rest of the club shall be left to the discretion of the
President.

Supervisor of Experiments {.title}
-------------------------

The SOX is an Executive Assistant charged with the creation,
decommissioning, and oversight of X-Ships. Specifically, the SOX is
expected to create an X-Ship upon receipt of a valid application,
decommission an X-Ship immediately after it meets the termination rule,
and continually monitor X-Ships for violations of the Terms of Service.

Restrictions {.title}
------------

Participation in any aspect of X-Fleet is restricted to active members
of the club as defined under the Membership Section of Member Order and
Organization (MOO). The rank possessed by any character in X-Fleet will
not apply to any member rank. Any sims conducted by licensed Gamemasters
within X-Fleet will not count towards a Gamemaster's rank.

Experimental Ships {.title}
------------------

An Experimental Ship is a role playing environment, upon which RPGs take
place under the supervision of the SOX.

Creation {.title}
--------

An X-Ship is created by the SOX upon receipt of a valid application for
an X-Ship. The application must contain the following information:

-   The names of five members who endorse the X-Ship's establishment and
    intend to play on it.

-   The usernames of the aforementioned five members.

-   The name of the proposed X-Ship, which must be unique.

-   A description of the proposed X-Ship that does not exceed 250 words.

The application will be deemed valid if it possesses the required
information, and if the following conditions are also met:

-   The proposed X-Ship is set somewhere within the Star Trek universe.

-   Nothing about the proposed X-Ship violates the club's Terms of
    Service.

-   The proposed X-Ship is not a deliberate duplicate of any existing
    ship.

The SOX will be responsible for determining whether a proposed X-Ship
meets the above criteria.

If the application is deemed valid, the SOX is responsible for ensuring
the X-Ship is created in a timely fashion and the five endorsing members
of that X-Ship are given administrative rights over the X-Ship.

If the application is not deemed valid, the SOX is responsible for
notifying the applicants in a timely fashion why the application was not
found to be valid. An invalid application may be resubmitted later if
the reasons it was found to be invalid have been addressed.

Decomissioning {.title}
--------------

If an X-Ship ever has less than five members who have posted on it
within the previous 14 days, it shall be considered on probation. The
members of the ship will be notified immediately and be given 7 days to
take corrective action. If at the end of the 7 days the ship does not
have 5 members who have posted within the last 14 days it is to be
decommissioned immediately by the SOX. An X-Ship may also be
decommissioned by the SOX if that ship's continued existence somehow
violates the Terms of Service. Violations of the TOS by a player who
happens to be on an X-Ship will not be grounds for decommissioning.

Any decision to decommission an X-Ship by the SOX is final and may not
be appealed.

Transfer {.title}
--------

There is no specific process for transferring an X-Ship out of X-Fleet.
The standard club policy for commissioning Standard Ships or Alternative
RPG Areas must be followed.

Exemptions {.title}
----------

X-Ships are exempt from FCOMM. Most Executive Departments and Assistants
are exempt from providing support to X-Ship. Here is a non-exhaustive
list of these exemptions:

-   The Gamemaster Department is exempt from providing a licensed
    Gamemaster to X-Ships.

-   The Personnel Department is exempt from providing new members to
    X-Ships.

-   Starfleet Academy is exempt from providing new graduates to X-Ships.

-   The Internet Department and Librarian are exempt from archiving
    content produced by X-Ships.

-   The Engineering Department will not be tasked with creating,
    maintaining or codifying specific ship specifications or
    technologies solely for the use of X-Fleet.

Trial Period {.title}
------------

X-Fleet will be reviewed six months after the date of this bill's
passing. The review will take the form of a public discussion held
within Command, with the President having the final ruling on whether or
not X-Fleet has passed or failed its trial period. The discussion must
run for a minimum of two weeks. The review criteria is to include:

-   Is X-Fleet providing enjoyable environments that are beneficial for
    those playing on them and the club as a whole?

-   Is the variety in environments provided by X-Fleet adequate?

-   Are we learning anything we didn't already know through X-Fleet

-   Are there any potential changes to the rest of the club that have
    been prompted by X-Fleet?

If X-Fleet fails its trial period, all X-Ships will be decommissioned
and the SOX position will be eliminated two weeks following the
determination of the failure. Once that is accomplished, this bylaw will
no longer remain in effect.

Should X-Fleet pass its trial period, then it will continue to operate
indefinitely under the terms of this bylaw.
