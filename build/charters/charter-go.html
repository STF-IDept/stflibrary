              <p>An Executive Department is a governmental department responsible for overseeing some aspect of STF's administration that is established in that department's charter. A Department may set internal policy as well as general policy for those matters relating to its sphere of influence, with the consultation of the President. An Executive Department is headed by a Departmental Director, appointed by the President, who shall name his own Assistant Director and, if needed, any other internal departmental positions. The Departmental Director is considered a member of the Cabinet. Further details of Departmental activity can be found elsewhere in other edicts.</p>

              <p>An Executive Assistant is a governmental "at large" officer responsible for some stated activity as defined by Edict. An Executive Assistant may set internal policy relating to his responsibilities, but is not empowered to set policy for the club at large. An Executive Assistant is appointed by the President, but is not required to appoint an assistant unless explicitly stated by Edict and is not considered a member of the Cabinet.</p>
