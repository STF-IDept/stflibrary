        <p>Executive Departments, Fleets, and the Office of the President (collectively "Departments") may request that the Librarian archive certain documents for which they are responsible on their behalf. Such documents may include complete works or collections of works. For the purposes of the Librarian, the submitting Department shall be considered the original author.</p>
        <p>The Librarian may accept or decline such a request based on the document's usefulness to STF at large, its compatibility with the rest of the Library, conformance to established standards for formatting, style, and layout, and the Librarian's current workload. A declined document may be resubmitted later should the reasons it was declined be addressed.</p>
        <p>Once a work has been accepted into the Library, the submitting Department may submit additions and modifications as necessary, which the Librarian may only decline on the grounds of improper format for such a submission or excessive stylistic errors (spelling, punctuation, etc.).</p>
        <p>A document may be removed from the Library only upon the request of the original author, demonstration that its presence as part of the Library causes some harm to the Library, STF, or the author, and with Presidential permission. If the original author is the President, the permission of the Vice-President will be required.</p>

        <p>A Department submitting a document to the Library may request that the document be treated as an Exempted Document. The Librarian is not permitted to make any changes whatsoever to Exempted Documents without the consent of the author, except those absolutely necessary for archival.</p>
        <p>An Exempted Document will only be considered if the submitter can show just cause for it to be considered Exempt, and with the consent of both the Librarian and President. A desire for artistic purity is generally insufficient cause for a document to be considered Exempt. If accepted, the Librarian may require a stricter format for change requests in order to facilitate changes without violating the document's Exempt status.</p>
