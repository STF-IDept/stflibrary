Supersedence of previous edicts {.title}
-------------------------------

Edicts Dipper \#7 and Hemenway \#33 are hereby rescinded and superseded
by this Edict.

Government appointments {.title}
-----------------------

There shall be three general types of governmental appointment made by
the President of STF:

 Fleet Commander 
:   The Fleet Commander of each Fleet shall be appointed by the
    President, who shall name his own Assistant Fleet Commander. The
    Fleet Commander is considered a member of the Cabinet.

 Executive Departments 
:   An Executive Department is a governmental department responsible for
    overseeing some aspect of STF's administration that is established
    in that department's charter. A Department may set internal policy
    as well as general policy for those matters relating to its sphere
    of influence, with the consultation of the President. An Executive
    Department is headed by a Departmental Director, appointed by the
    President, who shall name his own Assistant Director and, if needed,
    any other internal departmental positions. The Departmental Director
    is considered a member of the Cabinet. Further details of
    Departmental activity can be found elsewhere in other edicts.

 Executive Assistant 
:   An Executive Assistant is a governmental "at large" officer
    responsible for some stated activity as defined by Edict. An
    Executive Assistant may set internal policy relating to his
    responsibilities, but is not empowered to set policy for the club at
    large. An Executive Assistant is appointed by the President, but is
    not required to appoint an assistant unless explicitly stated by
    Edict and is not considered a member of the Cabinet.

As of the date of this Edict, the following Executive Departments exist,
per their chartering Edicts: Personnel Department, Internet Department,
Engineering Department, Gamemaster Department, and Starfleet Academy and
the Cabinet is comprised of the Engineering Director, the Gamemaster
Director, the Personnel Director, the Internet Director, the Academy
Commandant, the Fleet Commander of Fleet 1, the Fleet Commander of Fleet
2, the Fleet Commander of Fleet 3, the Fleet Commander of Fleet 4, the
Fleet Commander of Fleet 5, and the Fleet Commander of Fleet 6, as well
as the Vice President. The Librarian, the Marketing and Advertising
Coordinator, the Election Coordinator and the Coder exist as Executive
Assistant positions, per their chartering Edicts.

Chain of command {.title}
----------------

An Out Of Character Chain of Command exists within STF. As of the
issuance of this document, it stands thus:

-   President

-   Vice President

-   Cabinet members by order of rank

-   Club members by order of rank

The members of Executive Government Oversight (Egotists) exist outside
of the Chain of Command for the purposes of discharging their duties as
Egotists.

Presidential Succession {.title}
-----------------------

Should the Presidency become vacant through AWOL, resignation or
impeachment, succession falls to the next available member in the Chain
of Command, who shall serve until the next Presidential election.

Exception {.title}
---------

Any member in the Chain of Command who simultaneously serves on
Executive Government Oversight at the time of the Presidency becoming
vacant may not be considered for succession to the Presidency under any
circumstances and succession instead falls to the next available member
in the Chain of Command.

Should two members in the Chain of Command hold the same rank, time
served in that rank (minus any eLOA or iLOA) shall be the determining
factor in Presidential Succession or acting Presidential or Vice
Presidential status.
