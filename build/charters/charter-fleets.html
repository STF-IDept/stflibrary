          <p>A Fleet may be created by Presidential Edict. A Fleet must be filled with at least one Standard Ship and have a Fleet Commander appointed promptly. A Fleet may be decommissioned by Presidential Edict provided any ships within the Fleet are simultaneously decommissioned or moved to other Fleets. If a Fleet is decommissioned, the related Fleet Commander and Assistant Fleet Commander positions are eliminated.</p>

          <p>All Fleets are commanded by a Fleet Commander, appointed by the President. The Fleet Commander is considered a member of the Cabinet. The Fleet Commander is charged with seeing to the proper functioning of the Fleet under his command and the administration of related COs, XOs, and other Ship Administrators. The Fleet Commander is responsible for the outward image of the Fleet under his command, for reporting to the President and working with the President on matters of Fleet business, and other duties as specified in this and other Edicts.</p>
          <p>Specifically, the Fleet Commander is responsible for ensuring that the Ships under his command are healthy and properly functioning role playing environments, that the internal and external pages under his jurisdiction are maintained, and that fleet reports which detail the current status of each ship under his or her command are submitted to the President. The President is responsible for dictating in policy how and when fleet reports should be submitted.</p>
          <p>In the event that the positions of CO and XO on a ship both become vacant simultaneously, due to AWOL, eLOA, resignation, or other circumstances, the Fleet Commander may appoint an aCO and aXO. They must notify the President of such action and relay their recommendation on whether replacing the CO permanently is necessary or not.</p>

          <p>Each Fleet Commander is required to appoint a single Assistant Fleet Commander. The Assistant Fleet Commander's primary responsibility is to take over as acting Fleet Commander should the Fleet Commander declare a LOA. An Assistant Fleet Commander may declare the Fleet Commander AWOL with the consent of the President and assume the position of acting Fleet Commander until such time as the President appoints a new Fleet Commander. Additional duties may be assigned to the Assistant Fleet Commander at the discretion of the Fleet Commander. The Assistant Fleet Commander is considered a member of Command, but is not a member of the Cabinet.</p>

Acting CO or XO does not count.No individual may be the Fleet Commander or Assistant Fleet Commander of more than one Fleet at a time, nor may any individual be Fleet Commander of one Fleet and Assistant Fleet Commander of another Fleet at the same time.

          <p>A Standard Ship is any self-contained RPG Starship or Starbase, commanded by a CO, on which regular RPGs take place under the administration of the GameMaster Department and the Fleet Commander. All Standard Ships must reside in a Fleet and be a Starfleet vessel or starbase. Additionally, all Standard Ships are set approximately 376 years after the current modern year. That is, the year 2000 real time corresponds to the year 2376 In Character time, and one-year real time corresponds to approximately one year RPG time.</p>

          <p>An OOC Ship is a starship, starbase, or other similar division that is present in a Fleet or an Executive Department but not staffed by a crew or the site of an actual RPG. OOC Ships are intended for Out of Character interaction between STF members. OOC Ships are established managed at the discretion of the Fleet Commander or Department Director.</p>

            <p>Alternate RPG Areas are those areas where RPGs take place that do not meet one or more of the characteristics for Standard Ships. The President may establish by edict a charter for an Alternative RPG Area within a given Fleet, with the consent of the applicable Fleet Commander. If nothing is specified for a given parameter of the RPG environment, it is assumed to be the same as a Standard RPG Area. For example, if no time frame is specified, the Alternate RPG Area is assumed to operate in the same time as Standard RPG Areas.</p>

Their specific functions, including their specific title, will be specified by the chartering Edict if they differ from those of a standard ship. The Alternative RPG Area charter must also specify whether the Leader or Administrator position counts as an XO or CO position for purposes of XO and CO restrictions, and any special rules or circumstances regarding the naming of the Leader or Administrator. If not specified, the Leader or Administrator is called the Commanding Officer (CO), is appointed by the President in the same fashion as a Standard Ship CO, and will count towards a CO position as on a Standard Ship.</p>

          <p>All Standard Ships in a Fleet are commissioned by Presidential Edict, with the prior consent the Fleet Commander. The Fleet Commander must choose a ship name and a class approved by the Engineering Department for that purpose prior to commissioning. Starbases must have Engineering Department approved specs prior to commissioning as well. If the ship class as approved by the Engineering Department includes a list of ship names, the name must come from that list, with changes to that list governed by Engineering Department policy. No two ships in STF may be of the same name simultaneously.</p>
          <p>All Standard Ships are required to maintain the following criteria:</p>

          <p>Standard Ships and Alternate RPG Areas may be decommissioned by Presidential Edict. If a ship is decommissioned, all positions relating to that Ship are eliminated. For a Standard Ship, the appropriate Fleet Commander will work with the Personnel Department in order to place remaining crewmembers in positions equal or greater than held on the decommissioned ship, should they desire it.
