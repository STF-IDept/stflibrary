Revision 1

23 June 2005

Based on Edict [Garfield
\#23](http://www.star-fleet.com/prez/edicts/garfield/#e23)

An Alternative RPG Area is hereby established in Fleet Four, named
Crell.

Crell is a planet-based RPG, set on the planet Crell, homeworld of the
Crag species, a relatively new Federation member. There is a noticeable
non-Crag civilian population in the capital city of Crewel, although it
is a not-uncommon destination for off duty Starfleet Officers. Starbase
202 is in orbit of Crell.

Crell is restricted to existing STF members only. New recruits may not
be assigned to Crell.

Crell has no In Character Leader. It is a dedicated Self-RPG area. An
administrator appointed by the Fleet Commander will be responsible for
managing the MOTD and Roster only. The administrator position will not
count towards any CO or XO limits.
