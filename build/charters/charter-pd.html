        <p>The Personnel Department shall maintain a Mentors Program. This program is tasked with creating and maintaining a list of available people to mentor new members, and assigning mentors to new members who request them.</p>
        <p>A Mentor must be a current member in STF with at least three months service in STF. The Personnel Department reserves the right to approve or deny any Mentor application on any basis. All new members who request a Mentor will be assigned one.</p>
        <p>The Mentor's main responsibility is to provide a personal contact for the new member who requests it. This is done in order to assist new members who feel they need that little bit of extra help to settle in and role-play on their ships. Mentors are available to help with problems or queries the new member may have, and offer role-playing tips and advise on how to best fit into our RPG.</p>
        <p>No new member requesting a mentor may be placed upon a ship which has no active mentors in its roster. Should a ship not have active mentors, it shall be the duty of that ships Commanding Officer to recruit mentors and inform the Personnel Director and Mentors Coordinator of this.</p>

The Mentors Coordinator shall be appointed by the Personnel Director or named delegate. The Mentors Coordinator shall be responsible for maintaining the Mentors Program, maintaining an updated list of all current mentors, all current mentorees and shall track the status of mentorees monthly through a three month period from assignment. The Mentors Coordinator shall be responsible for assigning mentors to all mentorees within a 72 hour period from notification of their request by the Personnel Director or named delegate.
