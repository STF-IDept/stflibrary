MOVIE ERA SHIP CHARTER

A new Alternate RPG Area is hereby commissioned in Fleet Six, a TOS
Movie Era RPG Ship.

The USS Merrimack, Mariner-class, NCC-2346 is hereby commissioned in
Fleet Six as the TOS Movie Era RPG Ship. If for any reason the Merrimack
should change its class, it must be decommissioned.

The USS Merrimack will be structured the same as a Standard Ship, and be
commanded by a CO and XO who are appointed the same way as on a Standard
Ship and a GM who is appointed in the same way as on a Standard Ship.
However, the Merrimack will be set 293 years from today rather than in
the standard STF time frame. That places it shortly after the end of the
events depicted in "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country." The
Merrimack's time frame must honored with respect to technology that is
permissible, known species, species present in Starfleet at the time,
etc.

CO and XO positions on the Merrimack will count fully towards any limits
in place. The Merrimack will not accept new members to STF. It is a
Second Character Only Ship.

The Merrimack will officially begin service on or about 1 July. It will
be reviewed in 90 days on or about 1 October by the President, Fleet
Commander, and CO to determine if the Merrimack has been successful in
its mission. The President shall have final ruling in this matter. The
Merrimack will be reviewed based on the following criteria:

-   Has the Ship established an active and healthy Role-Playing
    environment?

-   Has the Ship established itself as a 23rd century ship, with all the
    anthropological and technological idiosyncrasies of the era.

If the Merrimack is found to be successful in its mission, it will be
considered permanent. It may be decommissioned at a later date should it
be found to be irreparably in violation of any of the points of its
mission. If the Merrimack is found to have failed in its mission, it
will be decommissioned. If the Merrimack is found to have failed in its
mission before its scheduled review date, it may be decommissioned prior
to its review date. Should the Merrimack be decommissioned at any point,
all characters and positions pertaining to it will be eliminated.
Promotions given on the Merrimack will remain in effect.
