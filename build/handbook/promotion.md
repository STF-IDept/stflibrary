Getting Promoted {.title}
----------------

STF is a club designed to allow everyone to have fun in a safe and
realistic Star Trek environment. How fast you advance can often depend
on how well you roleplay. Below are a few hints to help you on your way.

Make Your Character Real {.title}
------------------------

The more realistic you make your character, the more believable your
posts will be. Some of this is dependant upon your writing abilities,
but these will advance with time. The rest depends on how much
personality you give your character and how much time you spend
developing them.

One way to do this is with character development posts. Making posts
about everyday things, messages to friends and family back on your
characters homeworld and making new friends in the lounge are all ways
to develop your character. Flashbacks to historical scenes in your
characters past and anecdotes about their history all help flesh the
character out in your mind and give them more life to your fellow
players.

Another way is to include feelings, sensations and visual descriptions
in your normal posting. Posting about your character feeling nervous on
his first away mission or feeling fear in a combat situation is
something that will give your character depth and personality in your
own mind and in those of others.

Be Proactive {.title}
------------

Another way to impress and advance is to post proactively. Rather than
waiting for something to do, keep yourself busy with a Security officer
on his standard rounds, recalibrating phaser rifles. Doctors and
Scientists could conduct experiments, Engineers could make minor repairs
to key systems, such as realigning the warp core matrix or repairing
phase errors in EPS grids.

Holodeck simulations are always fun and they can help you bring others
into the fold with your character. The always popular holographic bars
from your characters youth or some sporting simulations can always be
fun for you and other players who join you.

There's nothing to limit you, though do remember not to detract from the
main mission the Gamemaster is running.

Most importantly, be creative. Use your imagination and throw some curve
balls at the rest of the crew from your own end.
