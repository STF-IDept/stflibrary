The STF Government {.title}
------------------

STF is administered by a President. This President and their Vice
President are elected once every eight months by the membership at
large, after a full election campaign has been conducted on a special
ship that only appears at election time called (surprisingly enough) The
Election Ship.

Anyone can run for President provided they receive two nominations for
the position. Following a period of voting, the winner is announced and
that President/Vice President team becomes the head of our government.

With the exception of the election process, the President has absolute
authority to do pretty much whatever they want. Naturally, were they to
truly attempt to destroy the place, the membership would demand that the
cabinet remove the President from power. This has never happened, but
there have been a number of controversial presidencies.

Generally speaking, a President has been judged fairly for character
during their election campaign. Furthermore, any reasonable president
will listen to the membership for advice, putting forward their ideas
for review before putting them into edict, just as they will listen to
membership ideas as to new methodologies and such.

When they assume office, the Presidents first duty is to appoint a
cabinet. The cabinet consists of the Directors for each of our
departments (Gamemaster, Personnel, Internet and Engineering), the
Academy Commandant and the six Fleet Commanders, along with the
President and Vice President. These then name their assistants to
varying positions within their departments. The cabinet, and their
assistants are referred to as the 'Government'.
