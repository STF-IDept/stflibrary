      <p>When STF began its first migration from the Prodigy classic chat network in 1999, the first guide to the Webb was written. Written by veteran member Larry Garfield, <em class="citetitle">"12 Steps to the WeBB"</em> was soon superseded by <em class="citetitle">"The Ensigns Guide to the WeBB"</em>, written by the New Members Council, a now defunct body designed to monitor new members and provide material to assist them in adjusting to our unique environment.</p>
      <p>The Ensigns Guide stood for several years before it was decided to write an Academy counterpart. After several drafts, <em class="citetitle">"The Cadet's Handbook"</em> was born.</p>
      <p>In 2001, it was determined that both books could be combined to streamline and codify practices to reflect relevant updates and provide a more comprehensive, yet user friendly format. With that, the first version of <em class="citetitle">"The Players' Handbook"</em> was born.</p>
      <p>Following the migration from the obsolete, yet revered, effWeBB to the more modern WeBBspace, it was determined that because of the drastic shift in format and style, a new handbook was needed. With this, the second revision of The Players Handbook was born and here we stand even with history.</p>
      <p>Whether you're a new Academy cadet or an old hand looking for immediate placement in a mainstream ship, this guide to our system and our format should answer your questions.</p>
