STF Academy {.title}
-----------

The Training Ships {.title}
------------------

The Academy ships are some of our many tools used to train new members
to function within the STF framework. The CO, XO, GM and DH's aboard the
Academy ships are all tasked with training new members in all aspects of
STF, from posting etiquette to character creation to the basics of
WeBBspace navigation.

The Academy ships are designed to function as a safety net for those new
members who are unsure of the system or who are unfamiliar with
roleplaying in general and would like some extra assistance that
couldn't be provided in the mainstream fleets.

Graduation {.title}
----------

Academy missions, unlike mainstream missions, last for only three months
to allow for a greater turnover. At the conclusion of three months
service in the Academy, a cadet is assigned to a mainstream ship at the
rank of Ensign.

The top cadets in each graduating class are offered the opportunity to
stay on as Department Heads to help train the next class of Cadets.

Academy Rules {.title}
-------------

Whilst serving as a cadet in the Academy, you aren't permitted to have
other characters aboard mainstream ships, nor any more characters aboard
Academy ships. After graduation, these restrictions are lifted and you
may have as many characters in as many positions as you'd like aboard
mainstream ships.

Cadets are required to post at least once every seven days (with the
exception of the Apollo, which is every 10 and the Discovery, which is
every four), though they tend to post once or twice per day,
facilitating the shorter mission time.

Should a cadet fail to post for more than 14 days, an email will be sent
and failure to answer that email will result in the cadet being removed
from the roster of the ship they were on. Should a cadet return after
being removed, they may ask the Academy Commandant to be reinstated on
the ship.

Academy Courses {.title}
---------------

The STF Academy offers a variety of courses which can be taken to
enhance your knowledge and compliment your skills in any given area.
Courses range from introductions to Counselling, Security, Science,
Medical and Engineering, to the Department Head course, the XO course
and the CO course. At the end of each course an exam is required in
order to pass that course. Each course is monitored by a tutor who
grades each exam submitted. Passing any of these courses is no guarantee
of a promotion or an appointment to the position in question, but CO's,
XO's, FComm's and the President do take exam scores into consideration
when handling applicants for a position.

There is also a GM course, which we require prospective GM's to pass as
one of the requirements for acceptance into the Gamemaster Training
programme.
