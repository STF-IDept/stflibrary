Chain Of Command {.title}
----------------

In STF, as in any organisation, it's important that we have a hierarchy.
Because of the military nature of Starfleet, we refer to this hierarchy
as the Chain of Command. The Chain of Command helps maintain the
administrative functions of the club, from each of our departments, to
our Fleet Commanders, down to our ship CO's and Department Heads.
Matters of discipline and site administration are handled by following
this chain of command. For all but the most unusual circumstances, the
chain of command for a standard player is as follows

JO -\> DH -\> CO -\> FComm/QDir (Cabinet Director) -\> President
