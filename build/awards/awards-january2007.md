Entertainment, Part I {.title}
---------------------

This entertainment was provided by Russell Watt

Taw\_Elocin: Hi, I recently wrote a little song about my hubby, Taw
Lessur, a science officer on the mighty USS Atlantis ... here it is.

\* Taw\_Elocin moves over to the microphone

Taw\_Elocin: When Lessur was a little boy, he proved so brave and
daring,

Taw\_Elocin: his father wanted to prentic him to some career space
faring

Taw\_Elocin: I was alas, in love with him, and so I went whereever

Taw\_Elocin: He went throughout space and in time he came to love me,
however,

Taw\_Elocin: 'Twas a life not made for a lass in love, a child of the
prophets

Taw\_Elocin: Though I'm a lass, you might do worse then sign him to the
Maquis

\* Taw\_Elocin moves across stage

Taw\_Elocin: I was alas focused on study and sadly did not listen,

Taw\_Elocin: When he said he'd join the Maquis and return Bajor or die
tryin',

Taw\_Elocin: Mis hearing his desire, while my PHD was under completion,

Taw\_Elocin: The Academy on Earth was the place I sent his application,

Taw\_Elocin: A sad mistake it was to make and doom him to the Star
Fleet,

Taw\_Elocin: I bound him to, a uniform - blue - instead of to the
Maquis.

\* Taw\_Elocin goes across stage again

Taw\_Elocin: I soon found out, beyond all doubt, the scope of this
disaster,

Taw\_Elocin: I was forbidden to, oh yes its true, to set foot on Bajor
thereafter,

Taw\_Elocin: But a Bajoran lass does not loose sleep, or give in to
confusion,

Taw\_Elocin: So I made up my mind to marry him and have with him some
children,

Taw\_Elocin: And that is how you find us now, with the crew on the
Atlantis,

Taw\_Elocin\> But we wouldn't be here, if I did hear and bound Lessur to
the Maquis.

\* Taw\_Elocin bows deeply to all in the room

Best Base or Planet {.title}
-------------------

This award was presented by Larry Garfield.

planet. In fact, if it were allowed to be included in the vote then

nominees are:

Crell: Scottie Testing Centre

Crell: Starbase 202

Crell: Oed V

Crell: And No Vote.

Crell: No Vote has recently been reclassified as an asteroid rather than
a planet, however, so it is disqualified.

Crell: Therefore, the award goes to.....

Crell: Oed V!

\* eagle15 drags Sy up on stage.

\* eagle15 takes cute photos with award and then lets Sy escape.

CaptBunny: Well, on behalf of my evil empire and my minions, I would
like to say thank you. Today this award! Tomorrow, Galatic domination!

Entertainment, Part IV {.title}
----------------------

This entertainment was presented by Larry Garfield.

Crell: In honor of our second best base/planet after Crell, the
Starfleet News Network is pleased to present this blast from the past.

Crell: Who would have thought a song from the 90s would be considered an
Oldie? :-)

Crell: With thanks to Mark Wilson and due apologies to Elton John....

Crell: "The Circle of Strife"

Crell: From the day we arrived on the planet

Crell: And stumbling, stepped off of the ship

Crell: We were told to build what could ever be built

Crell: Told to do what could never be done

Crell: Some say build or just loiter,

Crell: Some say, "I'll do it later."

Crell: But all come to see, as they look way up high

Crell: They will die for standing idly by.

Crell: We all like Oed V,

Crell: Now called "Arcadia."

Crell: It's a frightful place,

Crell: That's full of strife.

Crell: Till we build shelter

Crell: On the dark, dreary sand,

Crell: It's the col'ny -- it's called Oed V.

Crell: Some of us never built shelter,

Crell: And some of us built it right off.

Crell: Some of us work without com-plaint,

Crell: And some of us are like the sloth.

Crell: There's far too much to be built here,

Crell: More to do than can ever be done,

Crell: But the sand rolling high

Crell: Through the dark'ning sky

Crell: Makes us hol-ler and then turn and run.

Crell: We all like Oed V,

Crell: Now called "Arcadia."

Crell: It's a frightful place,

Crell: That's full of strife.

Crell: Till we build shelter

Crell: On the dark, dreary sand,

Crell: It's the col'ny -- it's called Oed V.

Crell: (repeat Chorus)

Crell: On the dark, dreary sand,

Crell: It's the col'ny -- it's called Oed V.

Crell: Thank you all! Remember to tune in to the SNN Jukebox for all
your musical irreverence!

Crell: All SNN Jukebox songs are aired on KNST, 93.99999 on YOUR
Subspace dial: http://www.star-fleet.com/snn/jukebox/

Crell: In may day I've seen the great, and the not so great.

cute she may be.

dead, so they're disqualified.

Crell: Alas poor Ballway. I knew him well, Horatio...

Crell: So leaving out the winners of yore...

Crell: We have a tie!

\* Crell breaks the award in half and hands one half of it to SARAH
HEMENWAY and the other half to RUSSEL WATT!

\* Russ goes up on stage

\* eagle15 asks Russ to get her half while he's up there.

Crell: Both of these fine young people are on my ship. Booya! :-)

Best STFer {.title}
----------

Dipper: My names is Jack Dipper, and in the next hour I'll be
reformatting my computer :s

Dipper: anyway, moving on

Dipper: Best STF Award...

Dipper: What does that mean

Dipper: Well, it's a combination of the best role player as well as the
person who has done the most for this club

Dipper: First I'm going to do the nominations,

Dipper: Brian Olinski

Dipper: Larry Garfield

Dipper: Sarah Hemenway

Dipper: Symon Silvester

Dipper: and No Vote

Dipper: Briefly, I'm going to chat about each of them

Dipper: Mr No Vote

Dipper: Well, where do I start

Dipper: He runs for President every election

Dipper: but, alas, is never elected

Dipper: one does wonder, though, how STF would fair under him

Dipper: Brian Olinski

Dipper: Brian has been a member of the club for some time; he was one of
my first Medical cadets

Dipper: I knew back then that he would be a credit to this club, and he
has been

Dipper: From supporting me as VCmdt, to actually taking the reigns, he's
been reliable fellow

Dipper: and a good old chap

\* Dipper ducks for the old comment

Dipper: Larry Garfield

Dipper: He's been a member of the club for a wee bit longer

Dipper: See Dipper Edict \#3 for details

Dipper: \*G\*

Dipper: That said, he's always lent his advise to anyone who dares
approach him

Dipper: Symon 'Bunny' Silvester

Dipper: Another person who lends his ear

Dipper: (pun intended)

Dipper: He's always been one to support people

Dipper: and his running of Oed V shows his leadership skills

Dipper: And I've left someone out, I know

Dipper: Sarah Hemenway - where do I start

Dipper: Firstly you were all foolish to elect her 6 months ago \*G\*

Dipper: No, seriously, Sarah does a lot of work behind the scenes

Dipper: she gives due thought to every decision, good or bad, that she
has to make

Dipper: and always seeks out the advice of those around her

Dipper: Sarah has been one of the best presidents we have had to date

Dipper: so it's only right that she gets the award for Best STFer

Dipper: (which she did)

Dipper: Although Mr No Vote was very close behind

Dipper: maybe he'll win the election in a couple of months

Dipper: Sarah, please come on up

Best STFer Acceptance and Closing Speech {.title}
----------------------------------------

\* eagle15 goes on up.

eagle15: Now, I have a speech, so I'm moderating you all again. ;)

\* Dipper hands over the award

eagle15: Thanks, Dippy.

\* eagle15 hugs and kisses Dippy.

eagle15: Winner's privilege, Mr. Dipper.

eagle15: Well, despite all of the work, one of the good things about
being the award coordinator is that I knew who won them all a week ago.
:)

eagle15: That means that I've had sufficient time to prepare an
acceptance speech. If you think that's unfair, you can just consider
this the award closing speech. :P

eagle15: I won this award last year, right before being elected
President. Whilte it meant a lot to me then, as I was shoveling through
election, uh, fecal matter, it means far more now.

eagle15: While I had an extremely active role in government then, it
wasn't the same as being President for the past six months. It's been a
unique experience, but despite some very low points, it's been one of
the best times that I've had in STF.

eagle15: I can't take the credit for it, though, as my Cabinet has been
wonderful and I feel like we've gotten a lot done for the club so far...
and there's still more to come!

eagle15: I really wanted to say something with this speech, but as I
tried to write it, the words just wouldn't come to me, so I'll leave it
with this.

eagle15: I once thought this was cliche, but it has meant a lot to me to
be given the opportunity to do some good (at least, most people say it's
some good \*g\*) for the club.

eagle15: I've put a lot of sweat and, yes, some tears into it and I
thank you all for this recognition.

eagle15: With this, I officially conclude the Hemenway administration's
STF awards ceremony.

eagle15: Thanks, guys, for really summarizing into three hours just what
I feel this club means to a lot of people:

eagle15: a community where we can laugh and have a heck of a lot of
fun...

eagle15: but take forever doing it. :)
