        <p>Taw_Elocin: Hi, I recently wrote a little song about my hubby, Taw Lessur, a science officer on the mighty USS Atlantis ... here it is.</p>
        <p>* Taw_Elocin moves over to the microphone</p>
        <p>Taw_Elocin: When Lessur was a little boy, he proved so brave and daring,</p>
        <p>Taw_Elocin: his father wanted to prentic him to some career space faring</p>
        <p>Taw_Elocin: I was alas, in love with him, and so I went whereever</p>
        <p>Taw_Elocin: He went throughout space and in time he came to love me, however,</p>
        <p>Taw_Elocin: 'Twas a life not made for a lass in love, a child of the prophets</p>
        <p>Taw_Elocin: Though I'm a lass, you might do worse then sign him to the Maquis</p>
        <p>* Taw_Elocin moves across stage</p>
        <p>Taw_Elocin: I was alas focused on study and sadly did not listen,</p>
        <p>Taw_Elocin: When he said he'd join the Maquis and return Bajor or die tryin',</p>
        <p>Taw_Elocin: Mis hearing his desire, while my PHD was under completion,</p>
        <p>Taw_Elocin: The Academy on Earth was the place I sent his application,</p>
        <p>Taw_Elocin: A sad mistake it was to make and doom him to the Star Fleet,</p>
        <p>Taw_Elocin: I bound him to, a uniform - blue - instead of to the Maquis.</p>
        <p>* Taw_Elocin goes across stage again</p>
        <p>Taw_Elocin: I soon found out, beyond all doubt, the scope of this disaster,</p>
        <p>Taw_Elocin: I was forbidden to, oh yes its true, to set foot on Bajor thereafter,</p>
        <p>Taw_Elocin: But a Bajoran lass does not loose sleep, or give in to confusion,</p>
        <p>Taw_Elocin: So I made up my mind to marry him and have with him some children,</p>
        <p>Taw_Elocin: And that is how you find us now, with the crew on the Atlantis,</p>
        <p>Taw_Elocin&gt; But we wouldn't be here, if I did hear and bound Lessur to the Maquis.</p>
        <p>* Taw_Elocin bows deeply to all in the room</p>

        <p>Crell: We all know, of course, that Fleet Four's Crell is the best planet.  In fact, if it were allowed to be included in the vote then nothing else would even be nominated.</p>
        <p>Crell: So, the award for second best best/planet after Crell... the nominees are:</p>
        <p>Crell: Scottie Testing Centre</p>
        <p>Crell: Starbase 202</p>
        <p>Crell: Oed V</p>
        <p>Crell: And No Vote.</p>
        <p>Crell: No Vote has recently been reclassified as an asteroid rather than a planet, however, so it is disqualified.</p>
        <p>Crell: Therefore, the award goes to.....</p>
        <p>Crell: Oed V!</p>
        <p>* eagle15 drags Sy up on stage.</p>
        <p>* eagle15 takes cute photos with award and then lets Sy escape.</p>
        <p>CaptBunny: Well, on behalf of my evil empire and my minions, I would like to say thank you. Today this award! Tomorrow, Galatic domination!</p>

        <p>Crell: In honor of our second best base/planet after Crell, the Starfleet News Network is pleased to present this blast from the past.</p>
        <p>Crell: Who would have thought a song from the 90s would be considered an Oldie? :-)</p>
        <p>Crell: With thanks to Mark Wilson and due apologies to Elton John....</p>
        <p>Crell: "The Circle of Strife"</p>
        <p>Crell: From the day we arrived on the planet </p>
        <p>Crell: And stumbling, stepped off of the ship </p>
        <p>Crell: We were told to build what could ever be built </p>
        <p>Crell: Told to do what could never be done</p>
        <p>Crell: Some say build or just loiter, </p>
        <p>Crell: Some say, "I'll do it later." </p>
        <p>Crell: But all come to see, as they look way up high </p>
        <p>Crell: They will die for standing idly by. </p>
        <p>Crell: We all like Oed V, </p>
        <p>Crell: Now called "Arcadia."</p>
        <p>Crell: It's a frightful place, </p>
        <p>Crell: That's full of strife. </p>
        <p>Crell: Till we build shelter </p>
        <p>Crell: On the dark, dreary sand, </p>
        <p>Crell: It's the col'ny -- it's called Oed V.</p>
        <p>Crell: Some of us never built shelter, </p>
        <p>Crell: And some of us built it right off. </p>
        <p>Crell: Some of us work without com-plaint, </p>
        <p>Crell: And some of us are like the sloth.</p>
        <p>Crell: There's far too much to be built here, </p>
        <p>Crell: More to do than can ever be done, </p>
        <p>Crell: But the sand rolling high </p>
        <p>Crell: Through the dark'ning sky </p>
        <p>Crell: Makes us hol-ler and then turn and run. </p>
        <p>Crell: We all like Oed V, </p>
        <p>Crell: Now called "Arcadia." </p>
        <p>Crell: It's a frightful place, </p>
        <p>Crell: That's full of strife. </p>
        <p>Crell: Till we build shelter </p>
        <p>Crell: On the dark, dreary sand,</p>
        <p>Crell: It's the col'ny -- it's called Oed V.</p>
        <p>Crell: (repeat Chorus)</p>
        <p>Crell: On the dark, dreary sand, </p>
        <p>Crell: It's the col'ny -- it's called Oed V.</p>
        <p>Crell: Thank you all!  Remember to tune in to the SNN Jukebox for all your musical irreverence!  </p>

        <p>Crell: In may day I've seen the great, and the not so great.</p>

        <p>Dipper: Best STF Award...</p>
        <p>Dipper: What does that mean</p>
        <p>Dipper: Well, it's a combination of the best role player as well as the person who has done the most for this club</p>
        <p>Dipper: First I'm going to do the nominations,</p>
        <p>Dipper: Brian Olinski</p>
        <p>Dipper: Larry Garfield</p>
        <p>Dipper: Sarah Hemenway</p>
        <p>Dipper: Symon Silvester</p>
        <p>Dipper: and No Vote</p>
        <p>Dipper: Briefly, I'm going to chat about each of them</p>
        <p>Dipper: Mr No Vote</p>
        <p>Dipper: Well, where do I start</p>
        <p>Dipper: He runs for President every election</p>
        <p>Dipper: but, alas, is never elected</p>
        <p>Dipper: one does wonder, though, how STF would fair under him</p>
        <p>Dipper: Brian Olinski</p>
        <p>Dipper: Brian has been a member of the club for some time; he was one of my first Medical cadets</p>
        <p>Dipper: I knew back then that he would be a credit to this club, and he has been</p>
        <p>Dipper: From supporting me as VCmdt, to actually taking the reigns, he's been reliable fellow</p>
        <p>Dipper: and a good old chap</p>
        <p>* Dipper ducks for the old comment</p>
        <p>Dipper: Larry Garfield</p>
        <p>Dipper: He's been a member of the club for a wee bit longer</p>
        <p>Dipper: See Dipper Edict #3 for details</p>
        <p>Dipper: *G*</p>
        <p>Dipper: That said, he's always lent his advise to anyone who dares approach him</p>
        <p>Dipper: Symon 'Bunny' Silvester</p>
        <p>Dipper: Another person who lends his ear</p>
        <p>Dipper: (pun intended)</p>
        <p>Dipper: He's always been one to support people</p>
        <p>Dipper: and his running of Oed V shows his leadership skills</p>
        <p>Dipper: And I've left someone out, I know</p>
        <p>Dipper: Sarah Hemenway - where do I start</p>
        <p>Dipper: Firstly you were all foolish to elect her 6 months ago *G*</p>
        <p>Dipper: No, seriously, Sarah does a lot of work behind the scenes</p>
        <p>Dipper: she gives due thought to every decision, good or bad, that she has to make</p>
        <p>Dipper: and always seeks out the advice of those around her</p>
        <p>Dipper: Sarah has been one of the best presidents we have had to date</p>
        <p>Dipper: so it's only right that she gets the award for Best STFer</p>
        <p>Dipper: (which she did)</p>
        <p>Dipper: Although Mr No Vote was very close behind</p>
        <p>Dipper: maybe he'll win the election in a couple of months</p>

        <p>eagle15: Thanks, Dippy.</p>
        <p>* eagle15 hugs and kisses Dippy.</p>
        <p>eagle15: Winner's privilege, Mr. Dipper.</p>
        <p>eagle15: Well, despite all of the work, one of the good things about being the award coordinator is that I knew who won them all a week ago. :)</p>
        <p>eagle15: That means that I've had sufficient time to prepare an acceptance speech.  If you think that's unfair, you can just consider this the award closing speech. :P</p>
        <p>eagle15: I won this award last year, right before being elected President.  Whilte it meant a lot to me then, as I was shoveling through election, uh, fecal matter, it means far more now.</p>
        <p>eagle15: While I had an extremely active role in government then, it wasn't the same as being President for the past six months.  It's been a unique experience, but despite some very low points, it's been one of the best times that I've had in STF.</p>
        <p>eagle15: I can't take the credit for it, though, as my Cabinet has been wonderful and I feel like we've gotten a lot done for the club so far... and there's still more to come!</p>
        <p>eagle15: I really wanted to say something with this speech, but as I tried to write it, the words just wouldn't come to me, so I'll leave it with this.</p>
        <p>eagle15: I once thought this was cliche, but it has meant a lot to me to be given the opportunity to do some good (at least, most people say it's some good *g*) for the club.</p>
        <p>eagle15: I've put a lot of sweat and, yes, some tears into it and I thank you all for this recognition.</p>
        <p>eagle15: With this, I officially conclude the Hemenway administration's STF awards ceremony.</p>
        <p>eagle15: Thanks, guys, for really summarizing into three hours just what I feel this club means to a lot of people:</p>
        <p>eagle15: a community where we can laugh and have a heck of a lot of fun...</p>
        <p>eagle15: but take forever doing it. :)</p>
