        <p>At the end of the Dominion War, Starfleet command was forced to deal with the consequences from the years of war, conflict, and skirmishes; Starfleet Defense was left in all but ruins.  However, the conclusion of this major war brought peace for the time being, so the task of rebuilding became the foremost concern of Starfleet command.</p>
        <p>The diminished defenses increased the risk of infiltration from Breen, Romulans, Sheliak, and similar species; Starfleet required ships that were capable while easily produced yet adhered to the principles of exploration and versatility that made the Federation what it is, such as the Intrepid and the Kearsarge.  Star-fleet R&amp;D opened the contract for new designs to it's closed network of independents, which included the newly formed Green Council, Intergalactic (better known as GCI).  GCI contributed the Victoria, designed to incorporate the best features from several designs into a compact, self-sufficient ship.</p>
        <p>The Victoria, as proposed by GCI's starship R&amp;D, is essence of versatility.  Armed for defense, but designed for long range diplomatic, research, and exploratory missions, primary mission profiles include:</p>

        <p>One major change from most starship designs is the lack of a "neck" connecting what would be the primary and secondary hulls.  Instead, the Victoria uses a unified, sectionless frame.  This frame, composed of the standard tritanium alloys, positions the aft portion aligned just below center of the thicker fore portion on it's Z-Axis.  This unified frame increases the amount of useable internal space and allows the structural integrity field to distribute stress over a stronger, more durable design.</p>
        <p>Six decks span the length of the ship because of this design, and the navigational deflector and main sensor array are located at the fore.</p>
        <p>The standard duranium/tritanium alloys compose the outer hull of the ship as well.  These alloys are layered in 5cm widths for a 6 meter total thickness along the entire hull.  A thin ablative armor finishes the starship form for maximum protection.</p>
        <p>The greater portion of the ship is noticeably the forward portion at about 60% of entire length.  The reason for this is to localize just about everything on board, decreasing the amount of on ship travel time to any location; the saucer is also about 50% thicker than the aft portion.  The aft portion localizes all of the engineering and maintenance aspect of ship's systems.</p>
        <p>A tried and true twin nacelle setup converts power into motion for the Victoria class.  These variable-geometry nacelles extend 30 meters from the hull to protect the ship, and during impulse flight the nacelles pull together and retract 10 meters closer to the ship to slightly improve the sub-c maneuverability and decrease the overall size.  During Warp travel, the arms extend and swing back up into  position.  In this manner they are like the nacelle setup on the Intrepid class.</p>
        <p>Another notable difference from most ships is that almost every part of the ship is tied into the main spaceframe, excluding the captain's yacht and the bridge module, which is locate at the fore of Deck 2 instead of the more common bulge from the top of deck 1.  This better protects the bridge from attack and makes the ship a sleeker, better spatial-dynamic design.   In order to replace a bridge, however, another module would have to be created to the specifications, as it is not standard starship configuration.</p>

The ship incorporates two of the latest Starfleet Mk 10 computer cores, located port/starboard spanning decks 3-5.  As required by Starfleet, each core is capable of running the ship should the other fail.</p>
          <p>In addition, a bioneural processing cluster is located on deck six and used specifically for processing central command applications during fleet command situations.  At all other times, it is used by the science and medical labs, and is linked to the computer cores to access data.</p>

        <p>Starfleet utilized GCI's Propulsion Division for it's power and propulsion needs.  GCI designers decided against a quad nacelle design because the added mass would affect sublight maneuverability.  They still wanted to stay top of the line, however,  so along with the starship design they submitted two of their newly developed PN-101 Variable Geometry Nacelles.  These nacelles contain more, thinner coils than a standard nacelle design to provide faster responses and overall better performance in the same amount of space.</p>
        <p>The warp power system runs off of a Starfleet standard warp core, rated at 1548 cochranes.  The ship features a cruising speed of warp 7, a maximum sustainable speed of warp 8 and a maximum velocity of warp 9.8.</p>

          <p>Because of the Victoria class' physically smaller size compared to most cruisers, and the fact that she is not intended solely for combat, R&amp;D chose to use several type IX arrays.  The thick foreward portion sports two dorsal and two ventral type IX arrays lining the port and starboard sides.  One dorsal type VIII stretches fore to aft along the spine from the back of the fore portion to the aft tail in the center of the ship. Another array stretches port-startboard on the ventral side of the aft section.  These 6 arrays allow for complete coverage with no blind spots.</p>

          </div>
          <p>The Main Bridge, unlike most starship designs,  is not a standard swappable module.  Instead it is set at the fore of deck 2.  Main entrance to the bridge is provided by two turbolifts at the back, one on each side.  Between those is the entrance to the large conference room, and the Ready Room is accessed from a door at the fore of the bridge, on the port side.  On the starboard wall just outside the turbolift is a Jefferies Tube hatch allowing access or escape to or from the bridge to the jefferies tube system.</p>
          <p>Near the aft of the bridge centered between the port and starboard sides, the Captain's chair find it's home.  The Captain's seat pivots 180 degrees, giving full view of the bridge. It includes a mini-console set in the arms allowing the CO computer access and control.  Seats for the first and second officers each are set in front of a console capable of mimicing any other on the bridge, or a combination.   The three commands chairs are risen above the bridge on a plateau.</p>
          <p>Stepping down, on the port side, Tactical (Tac) and Communications (Comm) stations line the wall.  The Tactical station is primarily on the port wall, but it extends slightly into the bridge, in an L shape, to allow the duty officer to face foreward when necessary.  Comm, aft of Tac, faces port and all consoles are on the wall.  Navigation has a standalone console on the centerline, a few feet away from the viewscreen.</p>
          <p>Opposite them, A longer line of stations line the wall and sweep out into the fore of the bridge.  These stations include Science, Engineering, and Operations(Ops).  This bridge setup is designed to divide the more essential combat and fleet command stations such as Tactical, Communications, and Navigation from the more "day to day" stations of Science, Engineering, and Ops.  It is assumed Ops and Nav are used during any situations, and so those stations are forward and nearer the centerline. This setup allows the Captain or Officer on Duty to survey the entire bridge, without having to look aft for information.</p>
          <p>The bridge is also equipped with several holoprojectors, allowing the Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH) to perform on the bridge.  In large battle situations, the holoprojectors are capable of reproducing the surrounding area in detail (much the same as in stellar cartography) giving a large, detailed 3-dimensional view of the battle using continuous sensor data.  This perspective allows for better visual coordination of fleet movement and strategy.  In these situations, the bridge, the command center of the ship, becomes an on-site fleet coordination and command center with up-to date, accurate, and real-time information allowing for faster planning and more strategic decision making.  This holographic display fills the open center of the bridge behind the Navigation and Operations stations.</p>

Each of the quarters still allows for a living area, a sleeping area with small bath and restroom, and small personal office.  Below, on deck 3, four VIP quarters allow the Victoria Class to host guests and perform diplomatic missions and diplomatic escort.  Two of the four allow for custom environments.  In addition, the isolinear computer cores begin on this deck, and span to deck 7.  Four Emergency Batteries are located on the outer edges of this deck for emergency power.</p>

          <p>The EMH Mk IV is equipped on the Victoria.  It is limited to the bridge, both sickbays, Main Engineering, and the holodecks.  No other part of the ship contains the necessary holoprojectors.</p>

          <p>One large shuttle bay fills the auxiliary requirements of the ship, located At the aftmost point of decks 9 and 10. Access to the ship interior from the bay is gained from doors on deck 10 directly to the flight deck, or by door leading from the control booth overlooking the bay on deck 9 the control booth has elevator access to the bay.  Shuttle elevators allows access to a hangar which allows storage for three shuttle sized craft, four worker craft, or a combination.  In general, one worker bee is stored in the hangar and two type nine shuttlecraft.</p>

          <p>As stated above, the bridge is located on Deck 2. Deck 1 is home to the Captain's Yacht.  Access to it is granted through the bridge turbolifts, which open into an airlock that grants access to the craft. The Yacht was built to fit flush with  the hull, which means it is slightly elongated and slightly wider than other yachts, that bulge out.</p>
          <p>To save space and because the yacht is used for diplomatic or escape purposes, it is also the Captain's Quarters and separated by a wall is his bedroom and bath.  The outer living area is furnished to entertain VIP's, and includes an office desk with a customizable interface set into a portion of it.  Also included in this main room is two chairs and a couch surrounding a low meeting table with four terminals.  The fore contains the small cockpit area, including a pilot and co-pilot seat and all related controls and displays.  The area is a step down from the rest of the yacht, visually separating it from the room.  In front of the cockpit, a wide, picture window gives a full, undivided view of space in front.  Along with the two windows on opposite sides, this picture window also provides a spectacular observation view of space for the captain and visitors.</p>
          <p>Two crewmen serve pilot duty when the yacht is deployed.  Each crewmen is expected to be able to serve as service personnel if needed when not actively piloting.  A small pilot bunk area is underneath the living/meeting area and access is through a hatch in the cockpit.  Engineering access is gained through hatches in the cockpit for sensor, computer, forward thruster and structural assemblies, and in the aft of the meeting area for structural, aft thruster, microfusion generators and drivers, and power assemblies.</p>
          <p>Underneath the Captain's quarters and part of the main room, six microfusion reactors provide impulse thrust and power needs for the yacht capable of propelling the vehicle at .22c.  The yacht is also  capable of landing on a planetary body, with an atmospheric cruising speed of mach 6. Four landing feet extend so the vessel can rest.</p>

        <p>The Victoria class is designed to handle long term exploration missions in deep an unexplored portions of the Universe as well as be rounded enough to handle any situation that comes along, remaining versatile enough to fulfill the many obligations required from a starfleet vessal.</p>
        <p>It is GCI and Starfleet's hope that this design and ships of this class will allow the Federation to finally return to it's original mission after many long years of continous war, and "to boldly go where no man has gone before".</p>
