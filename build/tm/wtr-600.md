Description {.title}
-----------

The wearable tricorder is based on tricorders used by the Saia people of
planet Vag. This device is designed to give the user an easy to use
device that frees up his hands for other tasks.

The device comprises of a main unit, and a power pack that is strapped
to the belt.

### Main Unit {.title}

The main unit is constructed of three pieces: the main processor
housing; a connecting piece that curves around the face; and a retinal
imager, attached to the end of the connecting piece, that is similar to
what the Dominion use to pilot their ships. The device stays in place by
a strap that goes over the head. The device comes in right and left eyed
versions, depending what eye is dominant.

The main processor housing is oval-shaped, and is about 10.2 x 6.5 x
3.17cm (Length, Height, Depth); the connecting piece is adjustable, with
the maximum dimensions being 11.2 x 1.9 x 1.2cm; and the retinal imager
is 3.4 x 1.4 x 2.1cm, all of the pieces being composed of
gamma-strengthened polyduranide. The mass of the entire unit is about
127.4 grams (0.28087lbs).

The processors is a reduced-size processors borrowed from the TR-590
Tricorder X. They have a rated speed of 280 giga-floating point (GFP)
calculations a second. There are also 6 wafers of densified cromopolymer
isolinear crystals for a storage capacity of 8.9 kiloquads of storage.

Communications are handled by a communicator with a maximum range of
forty thousand kilometers.

### Power Unit {.title}

The power cell is an induction-rechargeable sarium-krellide energy cell
with a rating of 22 hours continuous use and an average power level of
14.3 watts. It is contained in a housing that is also composed of
gamma-strengthened polyduranide, the dimensions being 9.5 x 7.62 x
2.84cm. The unit weighs about 150.6 grams. The power cell fits in the
holster normally designed for carrying standard tricorders. It connects
to the headpiece by a 65cm cord that retracts into the power cell
housing. In case the cable is broken, the unit is able to transmit power
via a subspace power linkup to the head unit, with a 20% loss of power
and usage time.

### Sensors {.title}

There are 295 mechanical, EM, and subspace sensors in the tricorder. 123
sensors are imbedded in the connecting piece and the retinal scanner
with a scanning arc of 3/4 of a degree, allowing the user to scan an
area just by looking in that direction. The other 172 omnidirectional
sensors are within the main processor housing.

### Interface {.title}

The user interfaces with the tricorder by speaking commands, which are
picked up by a microphone under the retinal imager. The microphone is
sensitive enough to hear whispered commands as well. The User can also
use 3 customizable buttons located on the side of the main processor
housing. The output is routed through the retinal imager, which scans an
image onto the user's retina. Output can also be sent by audio, through
a speaker located on the inner surface of the main processor unit. The
main processor unit and clip are padded to maximize comfort.

### Alternate Versions {.title}

There are two versions of the WTR, the standard version, and the medical
version. Both versions are the same, except for the fact that the
medical version has primarily biological sensors. The separate sensor
found in hand-held tricorders is not needed due to increased resolution
in the WTR's sensors.
