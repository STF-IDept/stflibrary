History and Mission Overview {.title}
----------------------------

In 2380, after a major fleet review, several members of numerous
scientific bodies in the Federation felt that almost all of the
auxiliary craft currently in use in Starfleet were majorly inadequate to
scientific field work. To counter this, many lobbied for a new research
and development project later that year, which ultimately gave way to
the Fulcrum Class Scientific Runabout being commissioned in 2388. The
prototypes and soon newly commissioned class of runabouts soon proved
popular with many scientific and exploration away teams allowing more
extensive studies while in the field.

### Mission Profiles {.title}

The mission profile for the Fulcrum-class is as follows:

-   To explore anomalies closer than a starship generally would with
    manned missions.
-   To perform reconnaissance missions ahead of a starship at low to
    mid-warp speeds.
-   To detect anomalies faster than would be possible otherwise, through
    the use of a smaller auxiliary craft.
-   To allow ships with minimal scientific abilities the ability to
    catalogue stellar phenomenon etc.

Structure and Construction {.title}
--------------------------

The Fulcrum class is shaped near the bow as an angular smooth nose cone
shaped hull. This then angles back to a sloping upwards rectangular box
shaped aft hull structure. Three angular pylons extend in a triangular
shape with two below the hull and one above. These add streamlined
dynamics for more efficient atmospheric and sublight speed travel. It
also provides more surface area for the mounting of required exterior
technology and better use of interior space.

The upper pylon contains the main sensor array in a triangular shaped
sensor pod, while the lower two pylons contain the impulse engines and
built in warp nacelles. The Fulcrum is built out of a two-decked,
single-layer hull frame made from standard duranium alloys. It was then
transporter welded to increase its strength and reduce construction
time.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems {.title}
----------------------------------

### Sensor Systems {.title}

The triangular sensor pod atop of the upper pylon houses a Class 5
sensor system, which is linked to the primary computer core directly to
allow for maximum transfer speed and analysis. This allows the Fulcrum
to pick up and relay anomalies, and other sensor data faster than other
craft or ships with a Class-5 system. This sensor system and tandem
relay network allows for a high resolution scan of 2.14 light years, and
a low resolution scan 7.0 light years. Finally, the main deflector array
is enclosed in a circular housing in the bow of the ship below the front
of the cone shaped cockpit on deck 2.

#### Computer Systems {.title}

The Fulcrum’s computer systems were one of the main focus points of the
research and development project with the intention of building a
superior and more redundant system structure than on other small
auxiliary craft. As a result, the ship contains not one, but two
individual and separated isolinear computer cores.

The first core, which is larger, is dedicated to the analysing and
archiving of input from the sensor pod and other sensory systems. It
also handles the retrieval and distribution of this information through
the LCARS operating system and MAJEL user interface. The core is located
along the ‘spine’ of the ship on deck 1, allowing it to take up as
little interior area as possible. The second core is smaller than the
first, and is used primarily for control of all primary systems other
than information gathering and distribution. As such it handles weapons,
navigation, transporters, and other associated systems. This core is
located at the far aft end of the ship, in an alcove beneath deck 2.

The Fulcrum utilises both standard isolinear and bio-neural systems.
These work in tandem to produce a more efficient overall system
response. The isolinear chips used on the Fulcrum class’ first core are
‘double coated’ with the isolinear crystal formula. This allowed for
extra storage space at the cost of transfer speed. The secondary core
uses standard isolinear chips. The whole ship is wired with isolinear
relays, with key junctions housing a bio-neural gel pack. This allows
for a more efficient transfer with lack of latency, and less packet loss
between junctions.

Warp Propulsion Systems {.title}
-----------------------

The Fulcrum class was provided with a standard Class 3 warp core, with a
Cochrane rating of 392. The core is mounted on the aft end of decks 1
and 2 with ejection systems propelling the core out the bottom of the
ship in an emergency. This warp core provides the runabout with a
Cruising Velocity of Warp 3.0, a Maximum Sustainable Velocity of Warp
5.0, a Maximum Velocity of Warp 6.0 for 12 hours and an Emergency Speed
of Warp 6.7 for 1 hour. This core feeds the ship’s two warp nacelles
through their pylon mountings.

Impulse Propulsion Systems {.title}
--------------------------

The Fulcrum class was provided with two standard micro-impulse reactors
and engines, one in each lower pylon extending from the ventral of the
ship. These combined provide a maximum speed of .25c. The engines
provide an acceleration to maximum velocity in approximately 31 seconds,
and to a full stop in approximately the same time.

Tactical Systems {.title}
----------------

### Defensive Shields {.title}

The Fulcrum class was provided with a Type-4 shield system, which
provides a maximum graviton load of 537 megawatts, and a maximum
dissipation rate of 1.46 x 10 \^ 5 kilowatts. Emitters for the system
are placed in pairs of two in a rectangular shape along the body of the
hull, primarily along the pylons and the angular hull lines.

### Phaser Systems {.title}

The Fulcrum class was provided with five Type-5 phaser arrays, each
providing a maximum of 0.3 megawatts of output at an effective range of
18,750 kilometres. These arrays are positioned as follows:

-   Two arrays to port and starboard, each with 10 emitters per array.
-   One array ventral and dorsal, each with 7 emitters per array.
-   One array at the fore of the ship, each with 5 emitters per array.

### Torpedo Systems {.title}

The Fulcrum class was provided with a type-1 micro-torpedo launcher,
which allows up to one torpedo to be fired every eight seconds. This
ship has the capacity to hold up to 15 standard micro-casings of
torpedoes, and up to 15 micro-probes of different classes. In addition
to standard micro-casings, the Fulcrum class utilises two expendable
external casings, which are mounted on the pylons. These allow the ship
to either mount two full sized standard torpedoes, or two full sized
probes for special operations/missions.

Command and Support Systems {.title}
---------------------------

### Cockpit {.title}

The cockpit includes three bridge consoles organised into the stations
of science, helm/navigation, and tactical/operations. The cockpit is
organised in a rounded triangular design, with the helmsman console at
the far front, science console to the right of the helm, and
tactical/operations to the left. This positioning allows for maximum
space to be used without waste.

### Engine Room {.title}

The engine room houses the main impulse reactors and the warp core for
the runabout inside a long rectangular room on deck 2. The warp core
runs vertically along decks 1 and 2, with the impulse reactor running
side by side on deck 2. Beside the warp core on the port side, there is
the primary computer core inside an alcove, which connects directly to
the impulse reactors for continuous uninterrupted supply of power. There
are two consoles along the length of the warp core and impulse
generators, one for the regulation and maintenance of each system.
Inside the alcove, there is a ring of consoles around the data core for
management and administration of the core.

### Mission-Specific Holographic Laboratory {.title}

The Fulcrum class’ main mission profile left Starfleet Corp of Engineers
with a new task - developing a large enough area to contain a full-blown
science, engineering, medical laboratories, and a sufficient sickbay. To
fulfil this within space constraints, they turned to holotechnology to
provide the answer.

This room, located at the centre of deck one, is circular in shape, with
a total projection size limit of 15 meters in diameter, and 4.3 meters
high. Specialized holoprojection walls and emitters contain the room’s
outline and major furniture within this area. This room has the
capability to be changed into one of four types of rooms set and
programmed before mission launch:

-   Science Laboratory - Contains a basic field science laboratory able
    to handle basic scientific research.
-   Engineering Laboratory - Contains a basic field engineering
    laboratory and repair shop to handle basic engineering repairs and
    research.
-   Medical Laboratory - Contains a basic field medical laboratory to
    handle basic medical research and examinations.
-   Sickbay - Contains a field sickbay able to hold a 3 patient biobed
    room and morgue unit.

The holoprojection is limited, however, in what it can produce. The room
is constrained to built-in components - anything that needs to be
handheld, scanners, or portable must be brought along in storage. In
addition, the storage lockers inside the Fulcrum are only large enough
to carry materials for one of the holodeck profiles for any one mission.
This requires restock at a starship or starbase to enable a different
profile to be loaded with the required equipment.

Utility Systems {.title}
---------------

### Storage Bay {.title}

The storage bay on the Fulcrum class is located behind the Holographic
Laboratory, towards the port side. The room is approximately two meters
square, and any materials and handheld equipment required for use within
the Holographic Laboratory are stored here.

### Tractor Beam Systems {.title}

The Fulcrum class was designed with one standard tractor beam emitter at
the dorsal aft section of deck one. This emitter has the capability to
move 907 metric tons out to a range of 50 kilometers.

### Transporter Systems {.title}

The Fulcrum class was designed with a single-person transporter pad,
located behind the Holographic Laboratory, to the starboard side. The
room is approximately two metres square, and the transporter has a
maximum range of 40,000 kilometres.

### Access Lift {.title}

The access lift used on the Fulcrum class is located behind the
Holographic Laboratory, towards the far aft, and is between the
transporter pad and storage bay. The lift is approximately two metres in
diameter, and provides access to both decks as needed.

### Crew Support Systems {.title}

#### Crew Mess Room {.title}

The Fulcrum class was designed with a single mess room, located just
fore of the engine room on deck two. The room is square in shape, at ten
metres by ten metres. This room is equipped with a single replicator
unit, and a four person table with chairs.

#### Crew Bunk Room {.title}

The Fulcrum class was designed with the crew capacity to provide living
spaces for up to eight people at any time. The room is square in shape,
at ten metres by ten metres. The crew bunk room is located at the centre
of deck two, just foward of the mess room, and contains eight beds
arranged into paired bunks with personal storage lockers.

Conclusion {.title}
----------

The development and production of the Fulcrum class allows Starfleet to
explore more scientific anomalies than generally would be possible with
standard starship operations. The class’ versatility with its
holoprojection laboratory allows a variety of field tasks to be
undertaken by away teams more efficiently than was possibly previously.
Further, it allows its parent craft/base to extend their range in
scientific endeavors and scouting missions.
