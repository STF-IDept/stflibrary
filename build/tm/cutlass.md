History and Mission Overview {.title}
----------------------------

Initially approved for service in 2376, the Cutlass-class medium
fightercraft served diligently for a decade in Starfleet. As the design
reached the end of its first decade of service, changes to Starfleet
Engineering design standards and improved technologies had rendered it
obsolete compared to newer designs. Consequently, AST Shipyards' design
team embarked on a re-vamp of the original Mark I Cutlass design to
create the Cutlass Mark II in 2386. The Cutlass-class medium
fightercraft has the following mission objectives.

-   Interception of enemy fighters.
-   Support of capital ships.
-   Reconniasince duty.
-   Escort of friendly ships.
-   Standard Patrol duty.

Structure and Construction {.title}
--------------------------

The Cutlass-class features a duranium/tritanium hull. The framework of
the craft is mostly tritanium, while the hull plating itself is
duranium. This gives the Mark II Cutlass a duller appearance than its
predecessor and serves as a basic stealth feature. The designers at AST
decided to retain the old design shape that featured a cigar shaped
fuselage: round at the nose and flat at the back, with the cockpit moved
slightly aft to sit directly amidships. Delta-shaped wings extend from
the body from amidships and meet at the aft of the ship. The wings house
the Mark II's stabilizing systems and some weaponry. The Mark II is
larger than its predecessor, measuring in at 13m x 10m x 3m. The
increases in length and width served to provide extra space for
new/improved equipment, while the reduction in height served to make the
Cutlass easier to fit into Starfleet hangars, as well as increase ease
of access for the pilot. The result is a craft with a much sleeker
visual profile.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems {.title}
----------------------------------

The Cutlass's computer and sensor systems were the biggest beneficiaries
of the redesign. The Mark II Cutlass' computer system is comprised of
two small isolinear cores, each with their own jobs to do in the control
of the ship's systems. One core, located forward of the cockpit, is
responsible for interpreting the sensor data and providing it to the
pilot. The first core is also responsible for relaying commands to the
forward phasers and thrusters. The second, located aft of the cockpit,
handles the main engines and life support systems. The second core is
also responsible for relaying commands to the ship's other weapons, and
aft thrusters. The two computers are linked by an ODN line to a
bio-neural gel pack located beneath the cockpit to synchronize the data
transmissions to the cockpit consoles and increase response time to
pilot command inputs. The Cutlass uses the Starfleet-standard LCARS OS
and MAJEL UI. The Cutlass-class uses Type II sensors, capable of seeing
1.2 light years around the craft in low-resolution, and 0.7 light years
in high-resolution. Cutlass-class fighters remain unable to detect
cloaked vessels without the aid of their carrier ship's sensors. Sensors
are located in the forward section, aft of the phasers. Cutlass-class
craft have only one holographic emitter, for the Heads-Up Display in the
cockpit.

Impulse Propulsion Systems {.title}
--------------------------

The Mark II Cutlass remains incapable of warp drive. Microfusion
generators located in the aft-most part of the fuselage power the
engines of the Cutlass. The maximum speed for the Cutlass is .30c. It
can go from 0 to .30c in 10 seconds, and from .30c to 0 in 13 seconds.

The Cutlass is also equipped with a series of RCS thrusters to allow it
to maneuver through tight spaces and perform dogfighting maneuvers. Two
thrusters are located in the nose of the ship (one above the phasers,
and one below), four amidships (two to starboard, and two to port), two
in each wing (one dorsal, one ventral), and two aft (one dorsal, one
ventral).

Tactical Systems {.title}
----------------

### Defensive Shields {.title}

The basic defensive systems of the Cutlass also received an overhaul.
The shields were upgraded to a Type-4 system with a Max Graviton Load of
537 MW and a Max Dissipation Rate of 1.46 x 10\^5 kW. A secondary Type-1
shield system with a Max Graviton Load of 80 MW and a Max Dissipation
Rate of 2.2 x 10\^4 was installed around the cockpit to protect the
pilot in the event of primary shield failure. This secondary system does
not activate until the primary shields over the cockpit are below ten
percent. The secondary shield system was added in lieu of ablative armor
over the cockpit, though the engine housings retain their 1.5 cm of
duranium armor plating, and the wings their 1 cm of duranium armor
plating.

### Phaser Systems {.title}

The phaser armament consists of two Type V pulse emitters housed in the
nose of the craft, between the forward thrusters. Another Type V array
covers the ship's backside. It is located directly behind the cockpit.

### Torpedo Systems {.title}

Each wing has one Type 2 microtorpedo launcher, slung beneath it. The
microtorpedo bay holds 24 microtorpedoes, enough for 12 per launcher.
The fighter can fire 2 microtorpedoes every 5 seconds. It can also be
outfitted with up to 24 microprobes, for missions including development
and deployment of sensor buoy lines around a system in danger of attack.
The firing rate for the launchers remains 2 micropobes every 5 seconds.

Command and Support Systems {.title}
---------------------------

The cockpit is located amidships, directly between the computer cores.
Inside the cockpit there are three consoles. The one on the pilot's left
gives sensor readouts. The console directly in front of the pilot
contains tactical readouts. The console on the right contains system
status readouts. The removal of the ablative armor from the cockpit
allowed the viewscreen of the Mark I to be replaced with a digital
Heads-Up Display (HUD). The HUD provides the pilot with basic
information on his direction and speed, and alerts him to immediate
threats such as torpedo locks or imminent collisions. The pilot controls
the ship itself through use of a manual steering column. The MSC has a
manual trigger for the ship's pulse phasers, and the pilot can control
the torpedo launchers and aft phaser array through either voice command
or the tactical console.

Utility Systems {.title}
---------------

The cockpit of a Cutlass is designed for use as an emergency escape pod.
In an emergency, the pilot can trigger explosive charges placed around
the hardpoint connections to the rest of the craft. The emergency escape
pod has minimal steering capabilities, though a single RCS thruster
powered by a solid-state chemical drive gives it thrust. The bio-neural
gel-pack beneath the cockpit that normally coordinates the two computer
cores is connected to this thruster and allows the pilot some
maneuverability. The emergency escape pod has life-support for three
days, and emergency rations for a week, along with a Type-III phaser
rifle. The rations and phaser are located in a locker beneath the floor
of the cockpit and only accessible if the cockpit is serving as an
escape pod. There are no replicators, holodecks, turbolifts or
transporters aboard the Cutlass.

Crew Support Systems {.title}
--------------------

Cutlass class fighters use subspace communication equipment that
includes encoded channel systems that allow for safe communication
between pilots trying to co-ordinate assaults. The fighters remain
attached to their carrier ship's internal comm-net up to a distance of
half a light year.

Atmospheric Recycling Systems located behind the cockpit provide air to
the pilot. Additional air is stored in tanks beneath the cockpit, enough
for thirty-six hours. This air is used only when the cockpit lifeboat is
ejected. Since not all pilots are human, alternative environment
survival equipment is shipped with the fighters for installation aboard
the carrier. Conversion to an alternate atmosphere within the fighter
requires three hours' work by a technician.
