Description {.title}
-----------

Any part that needs to be replaced on a star ship in any regular
interval is made in the star ship's machine shop. This reduces the need
for the ship to be in a star base port, or have storage rooms full of
star ships parts considerably. With a machine shop and a few storage
rooms, a few parts can be kept on hand. When a part is needed, it's
taken from the storage room and the old part is feed into the replicator
stock. When a particular part stock is starting to run short, the
Machine shop is set up for a run of that part.

As a general rule, the worst parts of making a part in setting up the
machine shop up to make a run. Once a machine shop has been set up to
make a part, it can start to make more of the same part with little
trouble.

For example, the ship is running low on photon torpedo casing. The set
up time for a run of casing is going to take 3 days and 10 crewmembers.
After that, it will take two more days to make sure that the torpedo
casing coming from the shops are being assembled correctly. After that,
the machine shop can start to crank out torpedo casing at the rate of 24
per day with now 75 people working production run in a 24-hour period.
By the second day, the shop is pushing out 58 casings with the same 75
people. The third day the 75 persons are pushed out at their most
efficient rate of 72 casing per day. At this point the ships machine
shop is working at maximum efficiency and cannot be made much faster
without permanently setting up the machine shop to build torpedo casing.
This run can continue like this till the shop is reset to make a new
ship part, the replicate stocks run out, or the ships completely filled
with torpedo casing to the point where walking around in the halls
become troublesome.

It should be noted that the machine shop is more of NPC area. In most
cases of complex parts, they are just kept in storage and when replaced,
the old worn parts are thrown into the replicator to make new ones. In
some cases, a part needs to be replaced but its not kept on hand. If a
part that normally is not kept in storage, this means its not expected
to need replacing that often. Replacing such a part is going to take
more time, manpower, and power to make this part.
