History and Mission Overview {.title}
----------------------------

After the conclusion of the Dominion War, the rest of the galaxy
returned to the semi-peaceful existence it had known before the
Dominion, before the Cardassians, before even the Borg. An existence
where, save minor border clashes between the Federation, the Klingons,
and the Romulans, there was absolutely no conflict. Even so, there were
some members of the Operations Department at Starfleet Command who spent
their workdays in cubicles wondering what was out there. The Dominion
had come practically without warning through the Bajoran wormhole. The
only thing that could stop another, stronger species from doing the
same, they reasoned, was intense exploration and knowledge.

With this in mind, Project Concord was begun on Stardate 05111.7, under
the direction of Starfleet Research and Development and personally
overseen by Admiral James Richard Nelson. Many argued for the
development of a stronger vessel like a frigate or a cruiser, however, a
surveyor - moderately armed as a necessity - was commissioned due to the
nature of the mission. It would need to be able to remain in an area
long-term, studying events that would interest at least one branch of
Starfleet. With the Concord, the Fleet would be able to study and make
contact if possible or necessary.

USS Concord, NCC-76520, the ship of line, was completed at Utopia
Planitia on Stardate 07070.9, a little over the year from the word being
given to proceed with the project. She completed her trials cruise on
07081.0, reporting only minor defects that were easily corrected on both
her and the other ships called for in the production order.

As described by the project parameters, the primary mission of the
Concord-class is to travel the Galaxy to study interesting new
discoveries, but in addition to that mission, a Concord-class ship is
also capable of the following missions:

-   Orbital survey of an uncharted planet
-   First contact with a newly discovered species
-   Cartography of uncharted systems

Structure and Construction {.title}
--------------------------

The Concord isn't the biggest of ships, measuring in at 100 meters tall,
20 decks overall. She makes up for this somewhat in her width, measuring
in at 300 meters wide, not counting nacelles. With nacelle measurement
included, the Concord is 372 meters wide, and is 410 meters long. The
design itself breaks two centuries of Starfleet ship design. It is a
linear design with an inverted-pyramid shaped forward section measuring
60 meters in length by 150m in width and 85m in height, containing
weaponry and tactical systems, that is connected to a 100 meter long by
100 meter wide by 50 meter high neck, containing personnel areas,
attached to a 250m x 300m x 100m aft section with propulsion systems and
command areas. The aft section is a cubic structure at and below the ten
decks that connect to the neck, with a 150 meter diameter saucer-like
area making up three decks on top of that cube. Decks 1-3 are solely
contained in the saucer on the aft section. Decks 4-13 go the whole
length of the ship, and make up part of the cube, the neck, and part of
the forward section. Decks 14-20 are either in the forward section or in
the aft cube.

This design allows for a unique form of compartmentalization.
Non-mission specific systems are clustered forward, mission-specific
systems are grouped midway through the ship, and command and control
systems are situated aft, allowing for maximum protection and control
over a situation.

Her hull is a hybrid of 87% duranium and 13% tritanium. This mixture is
just enough to lighten the load of the Structural Integrity Fields
during warp travel; the designers chose an angular design to both
increase storage capacity and provide for easy compartmentalization. The
navigational deflector is located in the forward pyramid, providing
shielding for the ship during its transit at warp speeds.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems {.title}
----------------------------------

The computer systems of a Concord run off a two-core isolinear main
system located in the aft section of Decks Six-Twelve, with two
additional isolinear backup cores, also located in the aft section of
Decks Six-Twelve. As a separate computer system would prove either too
difficult to adapt or too expensive to develop, MAJEL and LCARS were
chosen for the class.

The sensor systems on a ship of this class have to be top-notch. In part
because of the data required by Starfleet First Contact Protocols and in
part because a ship this lightly armed needs to know what is near it,
the subcontractor designed a system so powerful that if activated at
full, the sensors can "see" one-and-a-half times the clarity of a normal
system. The maximum ranges of these sensors are 14.75 light years for
low-resolution scans and 7 light years for high resolution scans.

There are no holographic crewmembers aboard a Concord-class ship.

Warp Propulsion Systems {.title}
-----------------------

The Concord-class is equipped with a small but powerful warp core, a
class-7 M/AM reactor that measures in at just over 1548 Cochranes. It is
horizontally positioned, oriented fore-aft, on deck 20, in Main
Engineering in the aft section, and propels the ship to a cruising speed
of Warp 6, a Maximum Sustainable Velocity of Warp 7.2, and a 12-hour
Maximum Velocity of Warp 9.5. The Matter and Anti-Matter storage areas
are located on Deck 20, aft section. The horizontal placement is in
order to facilitate easier fuel storage, via tanks located on either
side of Decks 17-20 and protected by the warp nacelles.

The Nacelles are mounted on a single pylon that runs through deck 17/18
and out 12 meters to each side, and extend from Deck 18 down to Deck 20.

The Concord is able to eject its core in case of emergencies by opening
a hatch beneath directly beneath the core on Deck 20. Similar measures
are available to eject the fuel storage pods.

Impulse Propulsion Systems {.title}
--------------------------

The six fusion generators that provide impulse propulsion on the Concord
are located in the aft section of Deck 10. Each impulse engine is
powered by three generators, making the maximum sublight velocity of the
Concord .25c.

Tactical Systems {.title}
----------------

### Defensive Shields {.title}

The Concord is equipped with Type-8 shields. These shields have a
Maximum Graviton Load of 1344 Mega Watts, and a Maximum Dissipation Rate
of 3.7 x 10\^5, and will protect the ship long enough for it to power
her warp engines and get out of the hostile situation.

### Phaser Systems {.title}

The Concord is not designed to be a show of force for Starfleet. Thus,
she is only equipped with five phaser strips, each of the Type-7
variant, located:

-   Deck 1: Aft section, dorsal/forward, running along the top of the
    saucer
-   Deck 4: Forward section, port/forward, running along the left side
    of the pyramid and cutting across the front.
-   Deck 4: Forward section, starboard/forward, running along the right
    side of the pyramid and cutting across the front.
-   Deck 13: Neck section, ventral, running along the bottom of the neck
    section.
-   Deck 20: Aft section, ventral/aft, running along the bottom of the
    cube.

All the strips have a minimum of 150 emitters, and are placed so as to
provide full 360-degree phaser coverage of the ship.

### Torpedo Systems {.title}

In keeping further with the scientific nature of the Concord, the
torpedo systems are simple. They consist of one set of tubes, one firing
forward from the port side of Deck 16, aft section, and the other firing
forward from the starboard section of Deck 16, aft section. The spacing
allows each tube to load from the ship's matter and antimatter stores.
The tubes are loaded from a torpedo bay, located on Deck Fifteen, aft
section. These ships carry 75 Mark-V photon torpedoes, which the tubes
can fire at the rate of one every ten seconds, and 50 Mark-IV scientific
probes, which can be loaded and fired out of either tube at a similar
rate. 25 casings are held in reserve.

Command and Support Systems {.title}
---------------------------

### Bridge {.title}

The Concord's bridge is located on Deck Two, in the forward section of
the aft saucer. It has a nearly panoramic view of space, augmented
forward by the viewscreen, which can display multiple images on separate
viewing segments. The viewscreen is located directly five meters in
front of the Command platform which includes the Captain's chair, a seat
for the helmsman to starboard of the Captain, and a seat for an
operations officer to port. Either the helmsman or the operations
officer will double as the XO. There is a Science console on the
starboard-side wall and a Communications console on the port-side wall.
Each of these consoles are primarily oriented on the bulkhead, but there
is a forward-facing control surface to input commands and view the
results on the bulkhead display. An integrated Security/Tactical Console
is placed aft of the Command Area, and an Engineering station behind
that, up against the back wall of the Bridge.

Turbolifts serving the bridge are placed to either side of the
Engineering station, with one on the left and one on the right, and
there is an entrance to the Ready Room behind the main Science station
and an entrance to the Briefing Lounge behind the Communications
console.

### Main Engineering {.title}

Main Engineering is located on Decks 18, 19 and 20, in the aft section,
around the Warp Core. There are workstations on each level that control
separate segments of the ship's power distribution grid, along with the
master console bank on Deck 19 that allows the CE or duty officer to
monitor the work of each station and override/adjust commands as needed.

The CE's office is located on Deck 20 in the aft section, a few feet
from the master controls and the Warp Core itself. A spare parts storage
facility is located on Deck 17, aft section, and contains things
engineering teams would need to repair the ship, like conduit sections,
and spare duranium plates.

### Security {.title}

The Concord has a small security section. She is decidedly not a combat
ship, but any ship can run into a security situation; so there is a
three-cell brig. Each dual-occupancy cell is secured by a Level-Four
forcefield. The office of the ship's COS is at the front of the Brig,
meaning that anyone who wants to access the Brig has to obtain the
permission of the Security staff. The Brig is located on Deck Six, aft
section, as part of an overall Security complex on that deck, including
two Holosuites that are primarily used for training.

### Science Labs {.title}

There are four science complexes on board the Concord. Each is located
in the forward section of its deck, has a different mission regarding
exploration, and is set up the same. The first complex is situated on
Deck Six and is devoted to Hydroponics, Botany, and Agrobiology. In
between the labs is a common office suite area with turbolift access.
Hydroponics, Botany, and Agrobiolgy are devoted to the study of foreign
flora and fauna.

The second complex is situated on Deck Seven and is devoted to Astronomy
and subsequent related fields. There is an Astrophysics lab and a
Stellar Cartography lab, again with an office suite area and turbolift
access in between. The Astrophysics lab measures gravitational waves and
conducts research on black holes. The Stellar Cartography lab extends to
Deck Seven as well, but the access point and the computer interface
systems are located on Deck Seven. A small Cosmology lab shares space
with Astrophysics.

The third complex is situated on Deck Eight. It is devoted to Geology
and Planetary Sciences, and contains the lower portion of the Stellar
Cartography lab. In between Geology, Planetary Sciences, and Stellar
Cartography is the same area of offices and turbolift access contained
by the other complexes.

The fourth complex is situated on Deck Nine. This complex is devoted to
the life sciences, with laboratories for Biology, Biochemistry, and
Zoology assuming space here. These labs are devoted to the study of
newly discovered bacteria, chemicals, and animal life. This complex also
contains the offices and turbolift access hub in between the labs.

As each science officer has a separate specialty, there is no designated
office for the Chief Science Officer. Instead, the head of each section
is accorded an office of the size typically accorded to a CSO.
Therefore, the CSO is also the head of one of the various sections in
the Department.

Utility Systems {.title}
---------------

### Cargo Bays {.title}

Concord-class ships have two cargo bays, the first of which is located
on Deck 14, forward section, and takes up the entire deck in the forward
section. This bay can be used to collect anything. There is also another
bay in the forward half of Deck 14, aft section, with the same purpose.
Both of these bays come equipped with cargo transporter pads to better
facilitate the collection of cargo.

### Tractor Beam Systems {.title}

The Tractor Beam is a standard piece of equipment onboard the
Concord-with the paired 16 MW Graviton Polarity Sources producing 32
Mega Watts of Gravity Displacing Power, effective up to a range
(assuming nominal delta-v) of up to 20,000 kilometers. The tractor beam
is located on Deck 13, neck section, so that it can direct captured
objects into one of the three cargo bays.

### Transporter Systems {.title}

The Concord has two sets of transporter rooms. The first set is of two
rooms adjacent to one another on Deck Four, neck section. The second set
is also on Deck Four, but in the aft section. Pattern buffers are
located beneath each set of transporters on the deck immediately below
it. Emergency transporters are located in the forward section of Deck
Eleven, and the aft section of Deck Twelve. Buffers for these are
located on the deck immediately below them as well. The standard sets
are capable of beaming 12 people onboard the ship every minute, the
emergency pads can beam up 12 every 30 seconds. Each room has six pads
and a control console manned by a transporter chief.

### Turbolifts {.title}

Concord-class vessels have three turbolift tubes, one for each primary
section, and all are connected to the Bridge and provide nearly
unlimited coverage to most of the ship. Each section �lift connects to
each other section �lift, allowing for easy transfer of personnel
between on and off-duty locations. Turbolift cars deploy out of a repair
area located on Deck Six, with holding areas located every few deck so
that critical calls can be routed faster than off-duty crewmen heading
back to their quarters.

Crew Support Systems {.title}
--------------------

### Sickbay {.title}

Sickbay is a critical area of the ship, and is divided into several
areas, each with a specific purpose. The first area is the General
Purpose Ward, where crewmen needing physicals or treatment for abrasions
and minor broken bones go. The second area is the Surgical Ward, where
crewmen with serious injuries that require surgery go. The third is the
Recovery Ward, where crewmen who survive the Surgical Ward go to
recuperate. The fourth is the Administrative Ward, where the office of
the CMO and his subordinate officers are located, and also where people
who can't be seen immediately are diverted. The fifth is the Morgue,
where bodies of deceased crew are stored until autopsies can be
performed. Those autopsies are performed in the sixth area, the Medical
lab, which is also used for medical research-such as new medicines and
cures. It is located adjacent to the final area, the Medlab. The Medlab
is where diagnostic medical staff work to run tests that cannot be
performed with tricorders or on biobeds. Sickbay is located on Deck Ten,
forward section.

### Replicators {.title}

There are replicators in all social areas of the ship. In every room on
the ship, there is at least one replicator. They can produce anything
from food to clothes. A Concord-class ship is equipped with enough
replicator stock to last it two and a half years.

### Crew Quarters {.title}

Crew quarters on the Concord are located on Decks Four through Twelve,
neck section. Quarters on Deck Four are reserved for the Captain, XO,
DHs and VIPs. Quarters on Deck Five through Twelve are reserved for
Junior Officers.

JO quarters have a reception area, a bedroom, a small head, and a
replicator. The reception area consists of a desk with a computer access
terminal and two chairs. Senior Officer quarters have a living room, a
bedroom, a bathroom, and a replicator. The living room contains the desk
with the computer access terminal, and three chairs. Captain, XO, and
VIP quarters have a living room, a bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchenette
and a replicator. VIP quarters can be adjusted to Class-H, -K, or -L
atmospheric conditions. Outside of quarters, dignitaries from those
atmospheres are required to wear pressure equipment.

### Holographic Recreation {.title}

The Concord has two holodecks, located on Deck Four and Five, forward
section. They are used for holo-recreation. There are also two
holosuites located on Deck Six, aft section in the Security Complex,
which are primarily used for training.

### CO's Ready Room {.title}

The Captain's Ready Room is located off the Bridge to Starboard. There
is a desk, three chairs, a small head, and a display area that can
display either starship models or a pet, depending on the Captain's
preference. The Ready Room also has a replicator.

### Briefing Room {.title}

The Briefing Room is located off the Bridge to Port. There is a long
table with seating for fifteen and computer access for those fifteen,
along with a viewscreen to display critical mission information, and a
replicator.

Another conference room is located on Deck One. This conference room is
used for diplomatic receptions.

### Crew Lounge {.title}

The Crew Lounge is located on Deck 12, neck section, and has seating for
125 people. There is a bar and a restaurant that serves the Crew Lounge,
and has a stage area that can be used for shipboard ceremonies or
karaoke night.

### Observation Lounge {.title}

An Observation Lounge is located on Deck 13, forward section, with
seating for 50 people. A replicator is available to provide refreshments
to any crew who desire them. The O-Lounge is designed to provide an
aesthetically pleasing and awe-inspiring view of space.

### Counselor's Office {.title}

The Counselor's Office is located on Deck 13, forward section. The
ship's CNS is expected to perform psychological evaluations of the crew,
offer psychiatric therapy, and serve as a mediator for shipboard
disputes.

Auxiliary Spacecraft Systems {.title}
----------------------------

The Main Shuttlebay of the Concord, located on Decks 13-14, aft section
of the ship, carries the ship's two runabouts. Flight Operations Control
is located on Deck 12.

A secondary shuttlebay is provided on Decks 18-20 in the forward
section. Having less space due to the slope of the pyramid, this
shuttlebay carries two Class-VII personnel shuttles. This shuttlebay has
a small Flight Operations Control on Deck 18.

A small bay that holds the Captain's Yacht and one small personnel
shuttle is located aft on Decks Two and Three. There is no Flight Ops
Control center for this bay.
