History and Mission Overview {.title}
----------------------------

In 2368 Starfleet was still recovering from the after-effects of the
Battle of Wolf 359. While rebuilding of its major exploration and
defense ships was still in the works, Starfleet began to realize it
required a more adaptive approach to many core designs. One, a venerable
cruiser design from the late 23rd century which had been refit in the
mid-2350s, was still a strong, viable design in the waning months of
2368. Starfleet decided to once again refit the Chandley-class heavy
cruiser with newer technologies just now coming online.

The design of the refit took longer than expected, and was eventually
halted during the Dominion War. After the war's end in 2375, work
resumed on the refits of the Chandley-class. Within a few months, the
first of these refitted cruisers, the USS Albert Einstein, was launched
with fully updated systems.

After its launch, the Albert Einstein was given to Starfleet Academy for
a shakedown cruise. Its shakedown crew consisted of a handful of senior
Academy training officers, the Academy's Red Squadron, and some senior
Cadets. While on its maiden voyage, the ship was apparently lost with
all hands near the Romulan Neutral Zone. No trace of the ship or her
crew was ever found. The accident resulted in a halt to the refitting
program while a Board of Inquiry investigated the Einstein's
disappearance. After the Board determined there was no fault in the
design, refitting resumed in late 2376, resulting in all remaining
Chandley-class cruisers returning to service by 2378.

### Mission Profiles {.title}

The Chandley class is suited to the following mission profiles:

-   Tactical and Defensive Operations
-   Contact with Alien Life Forms
-   Diplomatic Conferences and Negotiations
-   Exploration and Scientific Survey

Structure and Construction {.title}
--------------------------

The Chandley-class cruiser is a single piece, double layered hull
structure spanning 16 decks. It is composed from Duranium alloys
reinforced with energized hull polarization to increase resistance to
damage from combat, or other hazardous events. Each hull layer is filled
with 3 centimeters of Titanium hull fillings and transporter welded for
increased strength. A final layer of protection was added with 3
centimeters of high density Duranium alloy and plastics with reinforced
composite plastic sheets.

The saucer is shaped as a half circle near the front tapering back to a
rectangular box shape hull piece. The ship's two warp nacelles are
connected to the aft hull section via triangular shaped pylons in a
downward curve.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems {.title}
----------------------------------

### Sensor Systems {.title}

The Chandley-class mounts a Type 8 sensor system; the pallets for the
system are arrayed in groups of six along the saucer and engineering
hull frame. The system has a high resolution range of 3.8 light years
and a low resolution range of 12.3 light years.

The main deflector is positioned along the underside of the saucer piece
in an small recessed oval shaped inset on decks 11 and 12.

### Computer Core / OS / Network systems {.title}

The Chandley-class carries 2 two-deck computer cores on decks 10 and 11
port and starboard in the hull. They are combination cores made of
bio-neural gel packs to speed up response times and isolinear chip
storage. Bio-neural gel pack data transfer lines run along the whole
ship to all systems; a secondary isolinear system runs critical ship
systems in an emergency.

### Holo-crew {.title}

The Chandley-class has holo-emitters located in all major areas. The
class makes use of the EMH Mark IV program. In the event of main power
failure, the EMH is restricted solely to Sickbay, which has dedicated
emergency power systems to maintain the program.

Warp Propulsion Systems {.title}
-----------------------

The Chandley-class makes use of a Class 8 Warp core running in a
vertical fashion from decks 12 through 16, with ejection systems
propelling the core out the bottom of the vessel in an emergency.

The Class 8 core has a Cochrane rating of 1,909+, a cruising speed of
warp 6, a max sustainable speed of warp 9.2, a max velocity speed for 12
hours of warp 9.6 and an emergency speed of warp 9.8 for 1 hour.

Impulse Propulsion Systems {.title}
--------------------------

The Chandley-class has two closely clustered impulse engines situated on
the center areas of decks 2 and 3 at the rear of the ship. Between these
two engines the Chandley can reach a full impulse speed of .30c in 55
seconds and a full stop in that same time.

Tactical Systems {.title}
----------------

### Defensive Shields {.title}

The Chandley-class makes use of the Type-8 Shield array. Emitters are
arrayed about the ship’s core frame in key locations for maximum
coverage. The system has a maximum graviton load of 1612 MW and a
maximum dissipation rate of 4.38 x 10\^5 KW. The system also has
metaphasic programming for protection against solar radiation, solar
body entry, or other similar anomalies.

### Phaser Systems {.title}

The Chandley carries ten Type IX phaser arrays. They are positioned as
follows:

-   One array dorsal and ventral on the saucer, shaped as a half circle
    with 100 emitters each.
-   Two arrays port and starboard, dorsal and ventral, mounted on the
    nacelle pylons with 25 emitters each.
-   One array port and starboard dorsal and ventral on the four
    ‘corners’ of the engineering hull with 25 emitters each.

Each array is capable of a max energy output of 3.8 MW to a maximum
effective range of 225,000 km.

### Torpedo Systems {.title}

The Chandley class carries three Type-4 burst fire torpedo launchers and
one Type-2 standard mini probe launcher. The burst fire launchers are
mounted on the underside of the engineering hull on decks 15 and 16. The
standard mini probe launcher is mounted at the front of the ship on the
saucer on deck 4.

The burst fire launchers are arranged with one to the port and starboard
side firing forward and a single aft firing launcher in the center
sections of the hull. The burst fire systems can fire 5 torpedoes/probes
every 10 seconds, out to a range of 3,500,000 kilometers, while the mini
probes have a maximum effective range of 75,000 kilometers, and can fire
a single mini probe once every four seconds.

The Chandley carries 150 casings divided as follows:

-   55 standard photon torpedoes
-   50 assorted scientific probes
-   20 quantum torpedoes
-   10 tri-cobalt devices
-   10 miniature scientific probes
-   5 empty standard casings

Ships of the Class {.title}
------------------

Ships of the Chandley-class, have a varied naming history. The earliest
ones held names related to lesser known explorers, and families from
earth's history. The second batch of built Chandleys in 2350's refit
were named traditionally for minor inventors, families, and colonies
around Federation space. The present refit Chandleys of the late 2370s
however, though having few newer ships built at construction yards, are
named for inventors and scientists of Earth's history, as well as small
lakes and seas of colony worlds around Federation space. Because of this
long service life, and from losses over the years, few older designs
remain in service. As a result, it has created a varied registry list.

Conclusion {.title}
----------

With the refit of 2375, the Chandley class heavy cruiser went from a
secondary line vessel back to a hard working front line heavy cruiser.
It is capable of a variety of mission profiles for within and beyond
Federation space. Its refit has ensured a further long life of an
already long-serving class of ships.
