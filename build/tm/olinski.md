History and Mission Overview {.title}
----------------------------

"I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely seas and the sky." \*

Following the Dominion War, many in the Federation felt that Starfleet
had created combat ships for too long. In spite of a call for more
vessels focused upon the Federation's stated mission of exploration and
interplanetary cooperation, some military leaders feared that
disarmament might once again leave the Federation vulnerable.
Starfleet's Admiralty Board proposed a compromise. Along with many
scientific vessel designs, one large combat vessel would see approval,
provided that it could take the place of multiple smaller
combat-oriented vessels. With this in mind, the design, initially called
the Andoria class, was specifically built to counter any enemies that
the Federation might meet.

The design phase was accelerated, stealing some ideas from other vessels
in order to allow the full design to be completed in only seven years.
After five years of design, the first vessel began construction at the
McKinley Yards orbiting Earth. While they were not Starfleet's first
choice for making the newest generation of super-ships, the Yards were
relatively underused at the time, allowing the ship of the class to be
completed in an astounding eight years. After two months of
round-the-clock testing during its shakedown run, the ship class was
ready for commission.

The death of Brian Olinski led the designers to name the ship class
after him as a memorial to his exemplary service.

The Brian Olinski's mission profile is as follows:

-   Flagship vessel during fleet actions
-   Assault on enemy vessels, fleets and stations
-   Planetary defense
-   Orbital support for aggressive planet-side actions
-   Lone-vessel patrols in hostile areas of space
-   Criminal and pirate hunting
-   Convoy defense

Structure and Construction {.title}
--------------------------

"And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by." \*

For the Brian Olinski, the designers felt that a dish-type section with
two nacelles was appropriate. This was mostly because such a large
vessel would cause less damage to subspace if it were a single hull, and
because construction could be accelerated with a streamlined hull
design.

The "dish" is a diamond-style arrowhead shape, with the aft triangle
being two-thirds the size of the forward triangle, if the aft triangle
were allowed to run its full length. However, the aft point is aborted,
replaced by a flat surface. The two nacelles are on the ventral side,
each 200 meters from the midline, and the pylons on the nacelles sit on
a sixty-degree angle. One-third of each nacelle is beneath the dish,
while the rest of the length extends behind it. The nacelles are not
included in the deck count.

Each of decks 2 to 29 increase in width and length compared to the
previous deck, while each of decks 30 to 40 decrease in width and length
compared the the previous deck. On decks 37 through 39, there is a wide
opening in the hull, allowing access to the the fighter hangar. Two more
smaller forward openings run from deck 31 to 33, and allow access to the
shuttle bays. All of the openings have exterior drop-down doors.

The deflector dish is on the dorsal fore of the ship. It is circular in
shape, and is posi-tioned on a vertical inset in the hull. It stretches
from decks 26 to 29.

For most of the ship's superstructure and external shell, the shipyards
utilized regular welding and assembly techniques. However, once most of
this was finished, the yards used transporter welding to finish the rest
of the ship, which accounted for the fast build time.

The hull is a tritanium superstructure with tritanium/duranium supports
and titanium internal roofing, flooring, and walls. This allows the
ship's main hard points to withstand more force, as pure tritanium has
been found to be more durable - albeit more difficult to acquire - than
the alloy. A typical tritanium/duranium/insulation layer forms the
external shell. The ship has 2 cm of ablative armor covering the
entirety of the vessel.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems {.title}
----------------------------------

"And the wheel's kick and the wind's song and the white sail's shaking."
\*

### Sensors {.title}

The ship has type-VIII sensors, with a high-resolution range of 3.8
light years and a low-resolution range of 12.3 light years.

### Computer Cores {.title}

To provide multiple redundancies in the system, should combat result in
computer sys-tem damage, the Brian Olinski is equipped with five
isolinear cores. There is a central-ized core four decks high, running
from decks 19 to 22. Two other cores are forward, three decks high, and
go from decks 16 to 18, on port and starboard sides of the ship. The
final two cores are in the aft of the ship, on decks 24 to 26, close
together, so that they can share coolant sources. The entire computer
grid is also isolinear, and is capa-ble of segmenting itself in the
event of electronic sabotage. The system is the seventh-generation LCARS
Operating System with the MAJEL interface.

### Sickbay Computers {.title}

The two Sickbays are each equipped with two EMH Mark IV variants. Due to
complaints from other EMH iterations that they did not appreciate having
the same appearance as countless other programs, Starfleet Research and
Development has implemented new programming to make each EMH seem more
unique. As such, none of the EMH programs share any similarities in
appearance, although they all share the same medical database.

In the Upper Sickbay, they are designated as EMH White and EMH Blue, and
in the Lower Sickbay, they are designated as EMH Green and EMH Gold.
They are activated by color coding - e.g. "Computer, activate Blue." -
instead of simply telling the computer to activate an EMH, and have
colored bands around the cuffs of their uniforms to differentiate them.
They are customized, so that Blue and Gold are female, while White and
Green are male. The EMHs in the Lower Sickbay are more brief in their
speech, but not to the point of impersonality. They are all designated
as possessing the same rank and authority. They are present so that the
regular medical staff can have extra assistance during triage, and as
temporary replacements to multiple medical personnel.

However, should they be required to replace the entire Medical staff
aboard the ship, there is also a fifth EMH Mark IV which is not specific
to either Sickbay. It activates on the command, "Activate Primary EMH."
In order to differentiate it from the other EMH programs, it has the
[SWEDE](swede.html "Self-recording, Well-programmed, Emergency Doctor Entity EMH Plugin")
upgrade installed, and has authority over the other four in any and all
situations. Because of the primary EMH, all of the other EMH's are
programmed to understand gibberish.

Warp Propulsion Systems {.title}
-----------------------

"And a gray mist on the sea's face, and a gray dawn breaking." \*

The ship utilizes a Class VII warp core powering two nacelles. It is
five decks in height, from deck 26 to deck 30, with the main reaction
chamber placed in the Main Level of Main Engineering on deck 28. It is
capable of producing 1548 Cochranes, with a maxi-mum 12-hour speed of
warp 9.5, a maximum sustainable speed of warp 7.2, and a standard
cruising speed of warp 5.5. The nacelles are fixed-geometry. The
Deuterium Storage Tanks, Fuel Pumps, Fill Ports, and Injector Reactors
are on deck 25. The Anti-Matter Storage Tanks, Fuel Pumps, Fill Ports,
and Injector Reactors are on deck 31.

In the event that the warp core needs to be ejected, the ship has a tube
running from deck 31 to a plated hole on the bottom exterior of deck 34,
just forward of deck 35. The systems will unlatch the core from its hard
points, explosive charges will detach the plate, and a hydraulic piston
which is always attached to the top of the core will cause enough force
for the core to shoot out of the hull at 10 km/second. The piston is
located on decks 23 through 25.

Impulse Propulsion Systems {.title}
--------------------------

"I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide" \*

The ship has four impulse units, all mounted on the rear of the ship,
two decks in height, and each powered by four fusion engines. The two
upper units run from decks 10 to 11, with the fusion engines mounted and
connected on those same decks, and the two lower units run from decks 24
to 25, with the same setup.

The ship also has 300 extra thrusters on unused ship surfaces, which
allow the ship to turn ninety degrees in 8 seconds without any forward
motion. It reaches a maximum impulse of .25c. It can reach full impulse
in 26 seconds, and due to the extra thrusters, it can come to a full
stop in 30 seconds.

Tactical Systems {.title}
----------------

"Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied." \*

### Defensive Shields {.title}

The vessel, due to its size, has eight enhanced type-12 shield emitters
- four on top and four on the bottom. The four dorsal emitters are on
decks 6 and 7, spaced evenly around the dish. Two ventral emitters are
on decks 33 and 34, and are on the port and starboard, while a further
two are on decks 35 and 36, also on port and starboard, but farther
forward on the hull. Combined, they provide a uniform field that can
take a max-imum graviton load of 2688 MW, and which has a maximum energy
dissipation rate of 7.3 x 10\^5 kW.

### Phaser Systems {.title}

The Brian Olinski has a total of 7 type X phaser arrays - 4 dorsal and 3
ventral - as well as 2 type IX phaser banks. There is one phaser bank on
the rear of each nacelle, with four emitters a piece. They all have a
horizontal and vertical firing arcs of 180 degrees, a maximum energy
output of 3.8 MW, and a maximum range of 225,000 km. Akin to the design
of the Sovereign class, the 4 dorsal arrays and the 3 ventral arrays are
grouped together to form most of a ring around the top and bottom of the
dish section. The dor-sal array wraps around the top in a complete ring,
while the ventral array stops just be-fore the nacelles. Each array in
the rings has 250 emitters, a vertical arc of 150 degrees, a horizontal
arc of 240 degrees, a maximum energy output of 5.1 MW, and a maximum
range of 300,000 km.

### Torpedo Systems {.title}

The Brian Olinski has 5 main torpedo launchers total, each capable of
firing 7 projectiles per sortie. Two are dorsal, on deck 25, evenly
spaced along the forward part of those decks, and aiming forward. One is
directly aft, on decks 20. The final two are on either side of the
regular shuttle bays, on deck 32. They all have a maximum range of
350,000 km. The Brian Olinski carries a total of 300 casings. Of these,
60 are reserved as probes, 200 are Mark-V torpedoes, and 40 are Mark-VI
torpedos. The torpedo and probe casings are stored in separate rooms on
Deck 23.

### Fighter Weapons Storage {.title}

The Brian Olinski also holds 5,000 micro-torpedoes for the fighter craft
aboard. These torpedoes are stored beneath the fighter hangar on deck
40, and have a dedicated ele-vator which takes them up to the flight
deck. The torpedoes can be summoned via the elevator controls, and
transfer to the elevator via rail systems.

Command and Support Systems {.title}
---------------------------

"And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying." \*

### Bridge {.title}

The Bridge aboard the Brian Olinski comprises almost all of Deck 1, and
is circular in basic structure, with a diameter of 11 meters. There are
three basic levels, with the aft level being 0.4 meters higher than the
forward level, and the third level being sunken in to the forward level.

In the back of the forward level, there are two chairs - one for the CO,
and one for the XO. The starboard chair is for the CO, as it has command
controls specifically designed for the Captain. These chairs look
directly at the main view screen on the front wall of the Bridge. To the
aft port and aft starboard of these chairs are sets of two steps which
allow access between the forward level and the aft level. Directly to
port and starboard of these chairs are two turbolifts, both which lead
to the Emergency Bridge.

Directly forward of these chairs, sunken in by 0.2 meters and accessible
by a single step, is the CONN station, which accesses helm and
navigational controls for the ship. There is a single chair for the
officer manning the CONN. To the port of the CONN, but on the same level
as the CO and XO's chair, is the Flight Operations station. This
sta-tion provides a direct tactical link between the Combat Information
Center (CIC) and the Bridge, and allows for the CAG and the CO to share
information between each other about the status of auxiliary craft and
the main vessel. It has a chair in front of a single panel, as well as a
wall display detailing information relayed from the CIC. An Operations
officer typically mans this station. Directly across from this station,
on the starboard side, is a Fleet Control station. During fleet actions,
this station will relay information about other ships to the Brian
Olinski-class vessel, including tactical plans, ship status, and current
formation. Its physical arrangement is similar to that of Flight
Operations. An Ops officer or a flag officer mans this station, which
acts as a mission operations station during missions where an Brian
Olinski-class operates alone.

At the center of the aft level, there are two displays with a panel
underneath, with two chairs at each display. The starboard display and
panel includes the Master Systems Display and the Engineering station,
which allows the Bridge to access all technical information from the
ship. The port display and panel is the Science station, and allows the
Bridge to access all information from the sensors, probes, and
laboratories. To the port and starboard of these displays are doors
which lead to a corridor directly aft of the displays. This corridor has
a turbolift on a direct line to each door, as well as a stairwell in the
center which goes to deck 2. Farther to the starboard of the displays is
an alcove which is both the Tactical and Security station. The panel at
the fore of the alcove com-prises all of the ship's tactical controls,
from shield distribution to phaser fire. The rear of the alcove has
three displays and one panel, and allows the individual at the station
to access basic security information, current Brig status, and security
staffing information. In a similar position on the port side is an
alcove which is the Operations station. It has a similar setup, with a
forward facing panel that displays all ship operations, and allows the
individual at the station to allocate ship's operations according to
priority and capability. The three displays and panel at the aft of this
station offer the officer at this station a more detailed display of all
operations, including pending, ongoing, and previously rejected
operations.

### Conference Room {.title}

The Conference Room is where the senior command staff meets for mission
briefings, mission updates, and other situation reports. It has a total
of seventeen seats around a table, one at the head, and eight on each
side. Typically, they would seat the CO, the XO, the CE, the CMO, the
COS, the CSO, the Chief Operations Officer, the CAG, the Marine
Commander, and, should the vessel require it, the Chief Tactical
Officer, the Chief Intelligence Officer, and any command staff from
other vessels in the fleet, as well as flag officers present during a
fleet action. It is located beneath the Bridge on deck 2, and connects
directly from the Bridge via stairwell. For security reasons, the stairs
have soundproofed sliding doors at the deck 2 end. There are two
turbolift access doors on either side of the stairs. To the starboard
side of this room is the CO's office, and to the port side is the XO's
office.

### Emergency Bridge {.title}

Starfleet designers prepared for all eventualities, and created this
bridge to allow for the possibility of the Main Bridge's disabling or
destruction. This is a more compact design, located on deck 22, with
everything on the same level. The CO and XO's chairs are at the center,
with the same placement, but more limited functionality. Ops and the
CONN station are both at the fore of Bridge, with only a panel and a
chair for each. Ops relays only combat-related information, and so also
serves as an auxiliary Flight Operations station. These stations are
offset from one another to allow the CO and XO to see the view screen on
the front wall. Tactical is on a centralized station directly aft of the
CO and XO's chairs, and also serves as a security station. Aft of
Tactical is the Master Sys-tems Display. To the starboard of the display
is a simplified Engineering station, which has a chair, a single panel,
and a wall display about 16 inches high. To the port of the Master
Systems Display is a similarly simplified Science station with a layout
similar to that of the Engineering station.

### Intelligence Offices {.title}

Located on deck 5, these are a set of three offices linked by a central
lobby. Due to the fact that the Brian Olinski is designed to survive in
hostile territory, these offices allow the vessel to possess more
knowledge of certain situations than the average Starfleet vessel. These
offices provide a direct uplink to Starfleet Intelligence, gaining the
officers classified information at critical points. Each office is for
an individual Intelligence officer, and has a desk, a table, and three
chairs. The main lobby holds two tables, each of which has two work
stations containing a touch screen, a private intercom, and dividing
walls when needed, with junior Intelligence or Security officers using
each station.

### Security Offices {.title}

Located on Deck 12, the Security Offices serve as the main area for all
security officers. The only private office belongs to the COS. There are
six tables, and each table serves a specific Security division. Table 1
serves shipboard patrols and general security, table 2 serves external
security concerns - visiting personnel, for example - and hangar and
shuttle bay security, table 3 serves possible shipboard crime, table 4
serves shipboard criminal investigations, table 5 serves mission
critical investigations, and table 6 can serve as an expansion table for
any of the other specific departments.

### COS' Office {.title}

The COS' office is a large facility, with five displays for each of the
work stations in the main offices. It also has a weapons locker, with
room for two phaser rifles and two handheld phasers. There is a desk,
four chairs, and a bench.

### Brig {.title}

The brig is located on deck 18. There are two cell blocks. The main cell
block has six cells with two wall-mounted beds each. These cells have
energy fields to contain the occupants. The secondary cell block has
four cells, each of which is an isolation chamber. The cells have a
single bed and a private area to handle matters of personal hygiene, and
have a solid titanium door with an external-only lock, reinforced by a
force field, to contain occupants. Sensors and three cameras monitor
these occupants.

### Armory {.title}

The Armory is located on Deck 13, and is an extensive personnel weapons
area. The weapons available are type-II hand held phasers, type-III
phaser rifles, type-IIIa com-pression phaser rifles, tetryon pulse
rifles, and mortar-style mark-I photon torpedo launchers. There are five
lockers for each type of weapon. Barring the type-II phasers, which are
ten per locker, there are four weapons per locker. Ammunition for the
mark-I launchers is in the back of each launcher locker. Each locker
also has six sets of ener-gy-dampening personal armor vests. The area is
a restricted access location. The COS or the Marine Commander are at the
lowest level of authorization for the Armory, with the XO and the CO
being the only other individuals that can grant access to the room.

### Weapons Lockers {.title}

Outside of the Armory, each deck from deck 5 to deck 37 - except for
deck 13 - has three self-contained weapons lockers that are smaller than
the lockers in the armory. They are on inserts in the corridor walls,
with access panels that look like wall decoration to anybody that is not
trained in their use. They have a biometric access key combined with a
numeric data input, meaning that an individual's fingerprint is scanned
when inputting the code, and a retinal scan then confirms the identity
of the individual wishing to access the locker. When the ship is not at
alert, only the people granted ac-cess to the Armory are able to access
these lockers. When the ship goes to yellow alert, all officer-level
personnel may access these lockers. When the ship is on red alert, all
military personnel listed in the ship's database can access the lockers,
and the lockers only need to pass the first level of security to open
the lockers. Each locker has two type-III phaser rifles and four type-II
hand-held phasers.

### Engineering {.title}

Located on decks 27 through 29, Engineering is divided in to three
levels - upper, main, and lower - and is centralized around the warp
core reaction chamber. The warp core itself is central to Engineering,
with the rest of Engineering arranged around it in a mostly rectangular
fashion. The main entrance to Engineering is on the starboard side of
deck 28. The main entrance leads to a central control area on the main
level. It is a seven-by-ten-meter area that has an open side that goes
to the rest of Engineering and provides a view of the main reaction
chamber. The control area has with two tables, and two display panels on
each of the walls. The table closest to the entrance displays
information on all tactical systems. The table closer to the core
displays information on all command systems. The forward wall panels
display science and computer systems. The aft wall panels display crew
support and utility systems. The tables and the panels are all
interactive touch screens.

The flooring around the warp core on the main and upper levels are
titanium grating. Ladders on the port and starboard sides can be used to
access the lower level, while stairwells on the fore and aft ends allow
access to the upper level. The lower level has all of the remote manual
override access panels on the ship, while the upper level has all of the
direct controls for propulsion systems operations, including the warp
core, warp nacelles, and impulse engines. The upper and main decks can
be used to access the Jeffries' tubes, while the lower deck is reduced
in height to allow access to the cen-tral cabling junctions of the
isolinear optical data network, which run underneath solid plating that
forms the floor of the lower level.

On the port side of Engineering's main level is a secondary entrance
leads to a corridor that provides access to the Chief Engineer's office.

### CE's Office {.title}

The Chief Engineer's Office is directly connected to the main level of
Engineering, and is lined with information on the vital systems of the
ship. It has a desk and three chairs. The desk has a panel which
controls the layout of the displays on the walls, and allows the Chief
Engineer or the Lead Engineer on Duty to make slight modifications to
any system on the ship.

### Science Labs {.title}

The Science Labs are located on deck 15, and each one serves a different
purpose. There are labs for physics, chemistry, and biology - as well as
one lab for general or mission specific use. Access to the labs is
through the general lab. Each lab has its own room. All of them are
connected in a square pattern. Detailed sensor readouts can be accessed
here, as well as any data from probes.

The physics lab is connected to the chemisty and general labs has three
stations and two wall displays. The first station is a holographic
display with full capabilities, including providing simulations of mass,
density, viscosity, pressure, velocity, force, and energy. There is a
control panel on all four sides of the station, allowing multiple
officers to add or remove aspects of the simulation without much delay
time. The second station is for theoretical work, and is lower than the
first station. It has four seats, each of which has a touch screen work
station in front of it. It is capable of displaying more aspects than
the holographic display, as it allows people to work in four dimensions
using two-dimensional display methods. The wall displays are for atomic
analysis results. The third station is on the wall, and is a
communications station, allowing information sharing between the labs,
as well as to gain information from the sensors and probes.

The chemistry lab is connected to the physics and biology labs, and has
four stations. The first station is a computer-run chemical analyzer.
The second station is a theoretical workstation akin to the one in the
physics lab, but specialized for chemistry. The third station is a
physical station with beakers, test tubes, graduated cylinders, and
other such chemical experimentation tools. It has a cabinet below it.
The last station is a communications station akin to the one in the
physics lab.

The biology lab is connected to the general lab and the physics lab.
There are four sta-tions in this lab. The first station has four
microscopes, of varying sizes, but with the same capabilities. The
second station is theoretical, and is like the other theoretical
sta-tions, but geared towards biological experiments. The third station
is a catch-all station. It can be used to prepare specimens, analyze
living flora and fauna, do preliminary ex-aminations of dead tissue, and
whatever other uses the science staff can invent in the realm of
biology. The fourth station is a communications station.

The general purpose lab, in its default configuration, has four
stations. There are three theoretical stations which are copies of the
theoretical stations in each of the specific labs, and one
communications station, which is a permanent fixture. Although the
mis-sion of the Brian Olinski is primarily for combat and space
superiority, due to the ex-tended nature of some of the ship's missions,
this lab can be modified to become a basic laboratory for robotics,
stellar cartography, archeology, or astrosociobiology (also referred to
as extraterrestrial anthropology). For robotics, only two stations are
present - a theoretical station, and a large practical station which
allows for the manipulation of robotic devices and components via
gravitational and force fields. For stellar cartog-raphy, there are four
panels arrayed around a centralized three-dimensional projection field
that can show the area around the vessel in a spherical display (up to
the maxi-mum range of the sensors), and provide more detail of selected
areas, if possible. As an archeology lab, it is similar to the biology
lab, but the third station is an input area for a general cultural
database. As an astrosociobiology lab, there are three work stations
akin to those in the Intelligence offices, but they access more
specified cultural data-bases for crew use.

This lab has a walled-off area for the CSO, which serves as an office,
and has a desk and three chairs, as well as four wall displays detailing
the operations occurring in each of the laboratories.

### Marine Headquarters {.title}

Located on deck 32, the Marine Headquarters provides offices for the
Marine outfit aboard the Brian Olinski. It is smaller than the other
offices, with only room for the Ma-rine Commander's office and four
desks. The Marine Commander's office has The desks are all for one
person, and include a chair, two drawers on either side, and an enlarged
mobile PADD-style screen. This headquarters serves as a central area for
both Marine pilots and ground personnel, and can be reconfigured to
brief individual sections or squads.

### Pilot's Briefing Room {.title}

Located directly above the hangar on deck 36, it has sixty seats in
stadium style, a vid-eo display, and a podium. It allows the CAG to
brief pilots on their flight orders for the day. The room can send
information to all PADD devices, and the podium allows the CAG to
manipulate what appears on the screen. The seats themselves are padded,
with two arm rests a piece, and ergonomic backing.

### CAG's Office {.title}

Directly connected to the briefing room and the hallway which leads to
it, the CAG's Office consists of a desk, three chairs, and a display of
both the pilots' roster and the status of any fighter on board. As the
CAG is generally a pilot, the latter is defaulted to the CAG's personal
fighter.

### Flight Simulators {.title}

Located on deck 35, this area is a set of six linked single-level
holodecks. They are re-stricted to pilot use only, and only a pilot can
activate one, which is capable of simulating situations for one or two
fighters. The holodeck, however, only provides full-scale imitations of
the cockpit and shell of any of the four fighter types stationed aboard
the Brian Olinski class. Only a squadron leader or the CAG can activate
more than one of them and link the simulations. Unlike a typical
holodeck simulation, the exterior view from each fighter is only a
projection one meter away from the shell of the holographic cockpit. It
allows the pilot to react to the situation presented, and to feel what
would happen due to their reaction, from g-forces to impacts. However,
if one were to walk in to one of these holodecks during a simulation,
one would only see cockpit-size black blobs suspended in midair. These
simulators come pre-loaded with 300 different situations, all of which
have settings for individual and squad-based combat. They have emergency
power shutoffs accessible from outside of each room, as well as on
paneling above, on deck 34.

Utility Systems {.title}
---------------

"And the flung spray, and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying." \*

### Cargo Bays {.title}

There are two cargo bays a piece on decks 19, 21, and 23. They all share
a single transporter, located near Cargo Bay 1. They are each 5,400
cubic meters in size.

### Tractor Beam Systems {.title}

There is one emitter, located on on decks 35 and 36. It has a maximum
range of 15,000 km, and it covers an arc of 120 degrees in front of the
ship.

### Transporter Systems {.title}

Two rooms on each of decks 6, 7, 17, and 29 provide transporter
operations for the ship. Each room on decks 6, 7, and 17 have six pads
and a range of 40,000 km, while the rooms on deck 29, due to having more
surrounding decks, have eight pads each, and a maximum range of 30,000
km. This provides the ship with a total of 34 standard pads. There are
also emergency transporters throughout the ship, with a maximum range of
15,000 km. Each deck from deck 8 to deck 36 has six emergency transport
al-coves with one pad a piece. They are one-way, and activate only when
somebody has issued a general evacuation order.

### Machine Shop {.title}

Located on deck 15, the [machine shop](machineshop.html "Machine Shop")
allows for manufacture of parts which may not be in storage, or which
may be depleted, and lets the Brian Olinski last longer on a mission.

Crew Support Systems {.title}
--------------------

"I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life." \*

### Holographic Systems {.title}

There are three holodecks on the Brian Olinski located on decks 13 and
14, and a fur-ther three holodecks on decks 21 and 22, all sharing the
same programming. They can also access the EMH programs, if needed. They
are the standard two-deck configura-tion, and can be accessed on deck
14. There are twenty holosuites evenly distributed between decks 18 and
27. There are also two holosuites connected to the recreational lounge
which have limited capabilities, but still provide plenty of holographic
entertain-ment for an individual or a small group of people.

### Crew Lounges {.title}

There are five non-holographic areas which the designers provided in
which the crew members can relax. Both lounges have two replicators in
their respective bars

First, there is an Observation Lounge on deck 5, which allows for basic
lounge facilities. It seats 44 crew members at regular tables, 6 at the
bar, and an additional 6 at three gaming tables, all of which have
holographic projectors, allowing for games such as kal-toh, but also
more basic games like chess. It has windows on the fore, starboard, and
port sides of the room.

The Recreational Lounge on Deck 8 for general entertainment, including a
holo-emitter at the fore which can replicate a large number of
entertainers, a bar that seats 10 in the aft of the vessel, a dance
floor which is central to the room, and tables around the dance floor
that can seat up to 60 people. It has a view out of the port side of the
ship.

There are also three mess halls, one on deck 9, one on deck 16, and one
on deck 29. Each mess hall has six replicators and can seat 250 crew
members.

### CO's Quarters {.title}

The Commanding Officer's quarters take up three-fifths of deck 3. A
large bedroom with an adjoining restroom - including a sonic shower and
a tub with an attached water sup-ply - is at the fore of the deck, and
the layout is the captain's choice, although a closet is on the
starboard wall. Farther forward are a kitchen and a dining area. The
kitchen has both a small and large replicator, as well as an oven, a
stove, and a sonic dishwasher. The dining area is decorated as per the
captain's choice, but it can hold a table capable of seating eight. In
the main entrance area of the quarters is a sitting area. The CO can
customize the area with his or her choice of furniture. Individuals can
alter the lighting level in every area through eleven levels, from dark
to very bright.

### XO's Quarters {.title}

The Executive Officer's quarters take up the other two-fifths of deck 3,
and has a similar layout to the CO's quarters, but slightly reduced. The
bedroom is in aft of the deck, with a closet on the port side wall and a
restroom with just a sonic shower. The kitchen and dining area are
combined, with a stove-oven combination, a single replicator, and floor
space within the kitchen to hold a table for six. In the aft part of the
quarters is a seating area that allows visitors to the XO a place to
visit. Its configuration is entirely at the XO's discretion.

### Senior Officer's/Visitors Quarters {.title}

These quarters are on deck 4, and have the same layout. There is a
bedroom with a sonic shower attached in the rear of each room. A small
kitchen with a replicator, a preparation area, and a table for four is
in the center of the quarters. A sitting area for study and entertaining
is at the front of the room.

### CAG's/Senior Mechanics Quarters {.title}

Located on decks 32 and 35 respectively, these rooms have the same
layout as the Senior Officer's quarters, but there is an alcove in the
bedroom which houses a perma-nent workstation.

### Junior Officer's\\Pilot's Quarters {.title}

The JO's quarters on decks 6 and 7, and the Pilot's quarters are on deck
35. All of them have a bedroom with a sonic shower and restroom
attached. The front area of these quarters has a sitting area and a
small kitchen - replicator and preparation area - with space for a table
for two, side-by-side to the door.

### Crew\\Mechanic's Quarters {.title}

The Crew quarters are spread throughout the ship, while the Mechanics'
quarters are centralized around deck 36. They have a small open room
with an extra long twin bed, a restroom with a sonic shower with walls
and a door, room for a work station, a table, and two chairs. Each room
has a replicator built in to the wall.

### Marine Quarters {.title}

The Marine Quarters are on decks 33 and 34. The Senior Marine officers -
generally Sergeants and commissioned officers - are on deck 33, and have
individual rooms with a bed, a simple restroom, a closet, and a chair to
allow for them to ready themselves. The Junior Marine officers are on
deck 34, and have one bunk bed the length of an extra long twin, two
chairs, and two closets per room. The junior officers share two
re-stroom facilities located at opposite ends of the hallway which
connects to their quar-ters.

### Sickbay {.title}

The Upper Sickbay is located on Deck 10, and is designed for combat. It
has 30 beds arranged in an oval, with enough space for 20 additional
gurneys. 10 beds are reserved for critical care, up to and including
surgery, while the other 20 are for lower-priority patients. The CMO's
office is located here, and has a desk, three chairs, and two wall
displays, with one display dedicated to Upper Sickbay and the other
dedicated to the Lower Sickbay. The Lower Sickbay is located on deck 34,
and has 20 beds in a circular arrangement, along with space for 10
gurneys during an emergency. There are 5 beds reserved for critical
care. There is a reception area in both sickbays, which allow for
triage.

Auxiliary Spacecraft Systems {.title}
----------------------------

"To the gull's way and the whale's way, where the wind's like a whetted
knife." \*

### Combat Information Center {.title}

Located at the aft of deck 37, and looking out on the Fighter Hangar,
the Combat Infor-mation Center oversees all auxiliary spacecraft which
launch from and land aboard the Brian Olinski. The area consists of a
view port which looks out on the fighter hangar, five chairs, three
large panels, and two displays, both of which are status boards. The
port side display shows fighters and other craft under maintenance or
simply idle, while the starboard display shows fighters and other craft
that have launched, or are waiting to launch or land. The panels below
the displays allow the officers in the Combat Infor-mation Center to
access information on any given craft, while the panel in front of the
view port allows information relay to auxiliary craft, as well as to the
Flight Operations station on the Bridge. There is a rectangular table in
the center of the room with about one-third of the square footage of the
room that serves as a tactical display for the CIC. It displays the
immediate area around the vessel in a top-down grid fashion, with the
placement of all vessels. Its ratio is defaulted at 1/60000, but can be
zoomed in or out depending on what the staff in the CIC needs to see.
The table also has a holo-projector which can provide a 3-dimensional
perspective of the battle, incorporating the z-axis. Due to this
tactical display being of secondary importance for sensor use during
combat compared to information which the helm and tactical stations on
the bridge require, there is a two-second lag between real-time and what
the table shows. The CAG issues orders to all fighter, shuttle, and
runabout pilots from this area.

### Shuttle Bays {.title}

The two forward openings on the hull, covered by sliding plates, are the
main shuttle bays. They are three decks tall, from decks 31 to 33, and
each bay is 110 meters wide and 40 meters long. The crew can access them
from doors leading to deck 33. Each has a force shield which keeps in
atmosphere even while auxiliary craft arrive. Generally, the Brian
Olinski holds four Liberty-class runabouts in each bay, for eight total,
as the Marines tend to need something heavier than regular shuttles or
shuttle pods in their landing missions, and regular landing parties
benefit from a larger vessel as well. However, the bays can also hold
twelve Armadillo shuttles a piece - twenty-four total - or be converted
in to extra fighter hangars

### Fighter Hangar {.title}

The Fighter Hangar comprises the entirety of decks 37 to 39, with the
exception of Combat Information Center. At 300 meters wide and 450
meters long, it is a gigantic space, and therefore has additional
structural integrity and inertia dampening field generators. The opening
at the front of the hangar is 100 meters wide. Regular storage is on the
starboard side of the hangar, while the port side is for maintenance.
The central area is for landing and for fighters ready to launch.
Typically, the ship carries twelve Ranger-class bombers, twelve
Templar-class heavy fighters, and a further forty-eight Cutlass or
Compsognathus-class fighters, making six squadrons of twelve total. On
average, twelve to eighteen fighters are in maintenance, with a
dedicated mechanical crew on staff, one to two squadrons are on alert,
and the rest are sitting in their regular storage bays. At least one
squadron is reserved for Marine use.

Ships of the Class {.title}
------------------

—\* "Sea Fever" by John Masefield

In honor of Olinski's service to Starfleet Academy, the ships of the
class, except for the ship of the class and its brother ship, are named
for the cities that hosted military academies in the twentieth century.

-   USS USS Brian A. Olinski (Brother Ship), NCC-92340
-   USS USS Bear (Brother Ship), NCC-92341
-   USS USS Veracruz, NCC-92342
-   USS USS Colorado Springs, NCC-92343
-   USS USS Annapolis, NCC-92344
-   USS USS Monino, NCC-92345
-   USS USS Kharkov, NCC-92346
-   USS USS Dartmouth, NCC-92347
-   USS USS Marin, NCC-92348
-   USS USS Kingston, NCC-92349

Conclusion {.title}
----------

The Brian Olinski was designed to be a powerful vessel of war, capable
of surviving heavy engagements and coming out the other side looking
even more fearsome for it. Should the need arise, the Brian Olinski
class will become the weapon of a new war, and although the Federation
wishes to keep its image as a government of peace, few will doubt that
it is capable of fighting back with fury.
