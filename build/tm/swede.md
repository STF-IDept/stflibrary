Description {.title}
-----------

The EMH Mark I and EMH Mark II had been in service for some time when
certain members of Starfleet began to voice strong objections to the
system. Although they applauded the concept of the EMH, the interface
system was significantly lacking. The EMH Mark I suffered from the
bedside manner of a brick, and the EMH Mark II, while friendlier, was
far too flamboyant to be useful. One of the most vocal critics of the
EMH personality interface routines was then-Lieutenant (junior-grade)
Andriss Mardall of the USS Alliance. After several run-ins with the
Alliance EMH Mark I program, Mardall decided to take it upon himself to
try and improve upon the system. With the blessing of his captain,
Mardall began around Stardate 98051.2 looking into alternate interface
systems that could be added to the existing medical subroutines.

Mardall's research led him to Nyetscape Communications, makers of the
famous, and sometimes infamous, GORBI AI system for the Trafalgar-class
Destroyers. Of special interest was how Nyetscape had been able to port
the GORBI interface onto an existing system with the BORIS Starbase OS,
allowing for the continued use of existing hardware and databases.
Mardall brought a formal plan to Nyetscape Communications, asking for
their support and assistance with the project. In the beginning,
Nyetscape was unsure of both the possibility of success for the project,
and the sanity of the designer. However, when shown definitive plans for
the project, they were reassured. Mardall's dream had conquered even the
legendary Russian pessimism.

Lt. Mardall enlisted the aid of then- Lt. Cmdr. Murri Kep of the USS
Montgomery, who had worked on the original GORBI AI system while doing
an internship with Nyetscape at Starfleet Academy. In addition, many
production designers from GORBI did research into developing the
product, those that could be brought back from their early retirements
on Risa. At this point, the official name for the program (the
Self-recording, Well-programmed, Emergency Doctor Entity), as the
acronym SWEDE was introduced. Work continued, but was fraught with
difficulties. To quote Lt. Mardall, "The original problem involved the
terrible bedside manner of the EMH. This problem is proving difficult to
solve."

For four days, Mardall locked himself in his quarters (eating nothing
but replicated Andorian Tuber Root), and searched through the several
hundred years of voice files in the computer database, hoping to
discover the perfect voice. Many famous figures almost "got the job,"
historical and otherwise. Some examples include: Abraham Lincoln, the
16th president of the United States; Bugs Bunny, famous
late-20th-century cartoon character, Harrison Ford, popular actor; Mark
Twain, 19th-century author; and of course, Bond. James Bond. However,
none of these seemed to be quite appropriate for SWEDE. Mardall even
briefly toyed with the voice of the legendary murderer, Jack the Ripper!
After that, he continued searching, checking even the oddest references.
Finally, he discovered some damaged and extremely antiquated records
from late 20th century Earth tucked away in the personal archives of
some friends on Earth. They were of the TV (television, a primitive
method of data viewing on Earth) show called The Muppets. In the end, a
character on this show, 'The Swedish Chef', was chosen, due to his
light, humorous tone, and the obvious relation to the acronym SWEDE.

The SWEDE system, like the BORIS system before it, installed as an
overlay to the existing EMH program. Relying on the existing medical
databases and subroutines, SWEDE overwrote the personality algorithms
and interface methods while leaving the underlying code intact.
Inaddition to a new personality and vocal system, the visual interface
was replaced as well. The traditional bald Starfleet doctor was replaced
with a recreation of the same character on which the SWEDE's vocal
patterns were modeled. The final image contained the same beady eyes,
giant hat, and perverse smile as its namesake, which added to the jovial
atmosphere created by the vocal feedback system. To encourage starships
to upgrade, the SWEDE system included a new Adaptive Announcement
Algorithm (AAA). The standard EMH Mark I and Mark II interfaces both
used a standard "Please state the nature of the medical emergency"
message upon activation. In order to add to the more personable style
that SWEDE represented, the system was programmed with the ability to
assess the situation at startup and adjust it's welcome message
accordingly. In addition, during operation the SWEDE system can asses
the user's state of mind and adjusts it's conduct accordingly, varrying
the level of blood spurting depending on the tollerance of the patient
in question.

Admittedly, this unusual voice interface system alarmed patients when
tested, but as Nameless Lieutenant (j.g.) \#84 reported, "Oh, it was
great. I mean, sure he had a strange accent, but there was some kind of
reassurance in knowing that you were being taken care of by a guy who
originally cooked for a living, and badly, at that!" It was later
discovered that the Lt. (j.g.) was being sarcastic in his praise of the
product. He was duly executed.

Independent interviews conduced by SNN with some early patients at the
testing labs in Luvov, Ukraine revealed generally positive experiences.
As one satisfied tester put it, "I love SWEDE! I feel so comfortable
talking to someone positive and cheery! And I can't understand exactly
what he's saying, so I won't know if he bluntly says, 'you are going to
die.' Besides, my little boy loves it when he randomly throws lobsters
at the holochina set!" At this point, this patient was seen to hug his
2-year-old son lovingly. A special SNN Report later revealed that the
patient in question was quoted as saying "When do I get paid?!" after
the formal interview had concluded.

When the final release date for the product approached, many critics
complained. They claimed that the program was a joke, and that it would
never become standard Starfleet issue. In fact, it was a joke, which is
precisely why it has proven so effective. SWEDE is gaining universal
renown through the media. It is possible that, in the near future, SWEDE
will be the standard to replace the archaic EMH user interface systems.
