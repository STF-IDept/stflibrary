History and Mission Overview {.title}
----------------------------

After the destruction of Vulcan in early 2251 and in response to the
presence of a highly powerful craft from the future, Starfleet
determined that in order to effectively defend the Federation against
such potentially destructive forces, a more concerted effort should be
made to produce fast, maneuverable and powerful ships capable of
combating the significantly advanced technology of the future.

It quickly became clear that, with the exception of Enterprise and other
Starship Class craft, Starfleet simply didn't have enough combat focused
ships. Whilst it wished to maintain its primary function as an armada
for exploration, Starfleet Command also now appreciated that it needed
to begin placing a greater emphasis on its role as a peacekeeping force
in defense of the Federation.

Prior to the Nero crisis, Starfleet's McKinley Shipyards in Earth Orbit
had been in the early stages of primary spaceframe construction on a new
rapid deployment patrol craft known then as the Governor Class. With the
damage the primary fleet suffered at the hands of the Klingons in the
Laurentian System and with the vast majority of all near-Earth craft
destroyed at the Battle of Vulcan, Starfleet Engineering began issuing
contract assignments to civilian design and construction corporations.
With some small adjustments to the primary spaceframe, the design team
at fledgling starship development contractor Wolfestar Systems was able
to adjust it to accommodate one of their concept designs.

Marketed as a combat specific rapid response and space superiority
craft, the new Kurtzman Class Medium Battlecruiser marked a new era for
Starfleet. With an emphasis on heavier weapons and shielding as well as
enhanced structural integrity systems, Starfleet immediately ordered
construction to continue on the Kurtzman.

With the spaceframe already constructed, Wolfestar began an immediate
adaptation of the pre-existing Governor concept. With so much physical
and design work already complete, it was barely two years before the USS
Kurtzman left drydock and began its shakedown cruise.

The Kurtzman Class is designed to function in the following capacities:

-   Patrol of Federation borders and internal system borders
-   Rapid response to incursion
-   Command and Control support of larger battle groups
-   Ground based combat troop transport
-   Space based support of ground operations
-   Red Zone combat operations command

Structure and Construction {.title}
--------------------------

In appearance, the Kurtzman consists of a saucer connected to a tubular
star drive section via a dorsal neck mounting. The twin warp nacelles
are fitted to the aft section of the secondary hull via V shaped pylons.
It is similar in appearance to the larger Starship Class craft. The
Kurtzman's hull is composed of a duranium-tritanium alloy in a 30cm
double layer separated with 15cm of enriched duraplast foam. The outer
layer of hull plating is in a state of permanent polarization to enable
greater unprotected resistance to enemy weapons fire. The
duranium-tritanium trusses that support the outer hull are laser welded
to form a permanent support chassis.

During extreme emergency, explosive bolts are in place across the
nacelle-pylon connections and across the neck of the saucer-star drive
connections to enable either or all to be separated should it be deemed
necessary. Either the star drive or saucer section can be configured to
act as a life pod in case of disaster. An emergency impulse drive is
contained within the star drive, allowing the star drive, once separated
to operate at impulse speeds up to .15c. The saucer section is capable
of standard maximum sublight speeds, but is incapable of attaining warp
speed. Provided the warp core is viable, the star drive section will
operate at normal warp speeds after the default warp field geometry is
manually adjusted to a predetermined separation setting.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems {.title}
----------------------------------

The Kurtzman has an active and powerful sensor suite complete with a
general purpose science laboratory. A series of 200 sensors are
distributed throughout the outer hull. These sensors are used for
navigation, remote sensing, tactical analysis and early warning data
collection. Each sensor can be operated independently or in series in
both passive and active data collection mode. The whole forms the
collective 'sensor array'. The sensor array aboard the Kurtzman is one
of the most powerful in current service, with a high resolution scan
range of 1.5 light years and a low resolution range of 6.5 light years.
Through the application of high power emissions diodes, the sensor array
can be utilized as a jamming system to prevent enemy vessels from
sending or receiving transmissions. Effective jamming range for this
system at full power is 390,000km. It should be noted that effecting
this jamming system also prevents the jamming vessel from utilising
their own communications systems. Whilst only having basic scientific
facilities on board for basic tasks, these facilities are further
augmented by 50 empty torpedo casings which can, at need, be configured
for scientific or exploratory purposes.

### Computer Systems {.title}

The Kurtzman is designed and built with a dual computer core system. It
is outfitted with a D-3 Duotronic primary core, and a D-2 Duotronic
secondary core. The primary core is located in the centre of decks 3, 4,
and 5 of the saucer section, with the smaller back up core in the centre
aft of the secondary hull of decks eleven and twelve. The function of
the secondary core has largely been relegated to simple information back
up and storage. In an emergency, it can be reconfigured to operate the
Kurtzman's primary systems in a limited capacity, including navigation,
propulsion, weapons, shields and life support.

Each computer core is monitored from a main Computer Room on Deck 4,
maintained by at least two active technicians at any one time. Any
requests from the library computer must be issued through the main
Computer Room via an access terminal or through the issuance of recorder
tapes. The only information terminals capable of accessing the library
computer without passing through the computer room are those in the
Captain’s Quarters, the main Conference Lounge, Main Engineering,
Sickbay and the Bridge.

The Kurtzman uses a new wholly integrated Advanced Biometric Retrieval
And Management System (ABRAMS) for verbal and tactile computer input. It
responds to simple verbal requests and can perform simple tasks, though
it is incapable of extended factor calculation without a tactile command
input.

Warp Propulsion Systems {.title}
-----------------------

The Kurtzman utilizes a horizontally mounted Class-VI warp core
comprising six parallel linked reaction chambers feeding the two
nacelles. Ejection protocols are in place should the core ever breach
and through the application of explosive bolting technology and
hydraulic pistons. Ejection will occur within seven seconds. During a
warp core breach, the core is ejected through a series of six service
hatches directly aft from the Kurtzman's secondary hull. The warp core
for the Kurtzman is rated at 636 cochranes with a max velocity of
TOS-Warp-8.6 for 12 hours, a max sustainable velocity of TOS-Warp-8, and
a cruising speed of TOS-Warp-7.5.

NOTE: Comparison of TOS warp values and the more modern TNG-VOY warp
values can be found at http://www.star-fleet.com/ed/warp-chart.html, the
EDept Warpt Chart.

Impulse Propulsion Systems {.title}
--------------------------

The dual vent impulse drive is mounted directly aft of, and attached to,
the saucer section. The impulse drive is designed to propel the ship up
to 0.25c, with an acceleration rate from zero to 0.25c of 14 seconds,
and a deceleration rate from 0.25c to zero in 32 seconds. An emergency
impulse system is in place aboard the Kurtzman. In the event of saucer
separation or primary fusion generator failure, a series of three
micro-fusion reactors powering three adjustable vector exhaust vents
mounted in the central neck of the secondary hull are revealed through a
group of retracting hull plates. These are capable of propelling the
ship at a theoretical maximum speed of .10c and the separated secondary
hull at a speed of .15c. Slush deuterium fuel for the impulse and warp
drives is stored in three self pressurizing and self sealing tanks, two
primaries and one auxiliary. These tanks are located in Main Engineering
on deck 12. Deuterium reserves stored aboard the Kurtzman are sufficient
for a one month cruise. After 20 days, the ship must return to a
Starbase for resupply and refueling.

Tactical Systems {.title}
----------------

### Defensive Shields {.title}

The shielding systems of the Kurtzman consist of eight shield generators
located at key points along the spaceframe. Each generator is comprised
of nine 18MW graviton polarity sources feeding into a single 352
millicochrane subspace field distortion amplifier. During alert status,
the shield generators combine to provide a continuous graviton load of
1344 MW with a maximum primary energy dissipation rate of 3.7 x 10\^5kw.

### Phaser Systems {.title}

The Kurtzman is outfitted with the now standard combination of two
separate long range and point defense phaser systems.

Four Type VIII retractable phaser turrets containing two emitter cannons
each are mounted in the fore mid section of the saucer section, two
dorsal and two ventral. These turrets, when called into action, rise
from their holding pad and are capable of swiveling in a 360 degree arc
with 180 degrees of azimuth. These turrets are capable of engaging
targets at any angle, though a small area around the shuttle bay
immediately aft of the neck support is unprotected. These weapons have
an effective maximum range of 100,000km, producing 2MW of power per
burst. When fired, one cannon charges for eight tenths of a second
before releasing an extended lance of energy followed almost immediately
by the second, providing an almost overlapping appearance and allowing
for multiple target blanket firing by a single turret. Fully charged
phaser turret batteries are capable of producing continuous fire for up
to twenty two minutes before the turret shuts down, allowing a nine
minute cool down and recharge period. In this manner, it is unwise for
any Starship Captain to engage all weapons simultaneously, instead
staggering fire to allow single turrets to recover sufficiently without
leaving the ship defenseless.

The second phaser system is the Point defense Phaser System (PDPS),
comprising twelve Type VII retractable point defense phaser turrets
mounted in pairs of three in front of each primary phaser turret. Each
turret operates using the same maneuvering principle as the primary
phaser systems (raising itself one metre lower than the primary turrets
behind it), but each contains four emitter cannons operating in concert
at a much lower output setting.

The purpose of this system is to saturate the immediate space around the
vessel with high volume, relatively low intensity fire, intercepting
torpedo/missile weapons prior to reaching their target or combating
numbers of fighter craft which could otherwise prove too maneuverable
for the primary systems to hit. Each PDPS turret, when fired, charges an
emitter for one hundredth of a second before emitting a toroidal pulse
of energy. With each emitter operating in a cyclic fire pattern, a
single turret is able to output four hundred bursts per minute. Each
turret, operating at only 0.6MW output, is capable of sustaining short
range (10,000km) fire for up to nineteen minutes before requiring a six
minute cool down and recharge period.

The Type VIII phaser turrets are rated at a maximum energy output of 2MW
with a maximum range of 100,000km. The PDPS Turrets are rated at a
maximum energy output of 0.6MW with a maximum range of 10,000km. These
two turret systems are provided supplementary power from four dedicated
fusion reactors, two each located on Decks 3 and 7 respectively. As
standard, all phaser system batteries are maintained fully charged
whilst in standby.

### Torpedo Systems {.title}

Deck 9 is entirely occupied by the Torpedo firing systems. The Kurtzman
utilizes two torpedo tubes, both located at the forward edge of the star
drive. The loading system is semi automated and must be monitored by
groups of highly trained technicians. The torpedo systems are controlled
from the primary Torpedo Room located on a raised platform above the
loading docks on Deck 9. The torpedo loading system draws torpedoes from
a magazine storage bay in the rear of deck 9 through a series of
hydraulic lifting cranes. The torpedo is drawn from the magazine into
the loading area directly behind the torpedo tubes. It must then be
manually maneuverd into the tube using a locking pin which releases it
from the lifting rack. Once the inner torpedo hatch is closed, the
torpedo is locked into the launching mechanism which is capable of
tracking individually through the full 360-degrees, allowing targets
outside the firing arc of the launchers to be engaged.

The torpedo room is continually manned by at least four torpedo
technicians who monitor the status of all torpedo systems and perform
required daily maintenance, including replacing damaged loading runners,
monitoring torsional stresses on each of the loading systems and the
weekly launcher scrubbing that is required to maintain the system at
peak efficiency.

The Kurtzman carries a standard load of 150 photon torpedoes and 50
empty casings. Each torpedo tube has a designated load time of eleven
seconds and a standard fire rate of five torpedoes per minute. The
Kurtzman is the first vessel to employ the new Mark-III Photon Torpedo.
This weapon has an effective range of 1,000,000 km. The warhead consists
of six frozen slugs of 300 grams each of matter and antimatter in
magnetic suspension. Typical detonations yield the equivalent of 154.6
megatons. However, due to minute variations in the amount of
matter/antimatter particles which begin the annihilation reaction,
detonation yield may vary by an average of ten percent. Forcefield
attenuation of the blast yields a shaped charge effect, allowing the
total destructive energy to be unleashed on a desired target.

Command and Support Systems {.title}
---------------------------

### Bridge {.title}

The Kurtzman’s bridge is similar in layout to that of Starship Class
ships, in compliance with Starfleet's desire to introduce more
uniformity to its critical systems layout.

The Bridge is located on deck 1. The center of the bridge is occupied by
a raised platform on which the Captain's chair is placed. To the left
and right of the Captain's chair are the tactical and operations
stations. Tactical and Operations consist of two standing stations which
receive sensor feeds from their appropriate grids. Behind these stations
are transparent tactile interface panels which are suspended from floor
and ceiling. These panels are capable of projecting any desired readout
or view necessary to that station's function.

Behind these panels along the rear edge of the bridge walls are the
engineering stations. Each station is designed to be manned by two
officers. Along the top of the bulkhead is a continuous engineering plot
for all major systems in a panoramic monitor and each station is capable
of controlling primary and secondary systems.

The primary turbolift access to the bridge is between the two
engineering stations, bringing visitors onto the bridge directly aft of
the Captain’s chair. To the right of the left hand station is a doorway
leading through to the tactical planning chamber which is used for all
mission planning and operational scenarios. To the left of the right
hand station is the exit to the Jeffries tube access for the Bridge
deck.

To the right of the tactical planning room doorway is the main
communications station. In layout this is identical to the engineering
station, but providing communications specific information and utilizing
the long range subspace relay systems.

To the left of the Jeffries tube access doorway is the main science
station, usually occupied by the ships First Officer and/or Chief
Science Officer. As with the other rear wall stations, this is identical
in layout but provides active and passive sensor information as well as
internal sensor readouts and station specific information.

Directly in front of the Captain's chair, in a lowered area, are the
Helm and Navigation/Weapons station. This station comprises a single
long panel separated by a computer control interface and plotting tablet
in the centre. The helm officer sits to the left, the navigator/weapons
officer to the right.

At the extreme front of the bridge is the main viewscreen, raised above
all over stations to provide unobstructed view to all bridge officers.

### Auxiliary Control {.title}

The Auxiliary Control Room is located on deck 4. It is continually
manned and maintained by four junior officers. In the event of a
ship-wide catastrophe, all the major ship's functions can be controlled
from here. In layout it is similar to the main bridge but smaller and
without the sunken area or transparent panels. In the star drive, Main
Engineering serves as auxiliary control, with primary systems being
routed through a control room located adjacent to the primary
engineering platform. A small viewscreen operates in the same capacity
as its larger cousin and this control room can be manned by as few as
four people. This control room has customizable stations capable of
controlling each of the ships primary functions, but in four person mode
the default stations are Navigation/Tactical, Conn and Science.

### Armory {.title}

The Ship's Armory is located on Deck 8, directly above the Torpedo Room.
The armory is stocked with a usual complement of 100 Type-II hand
phasers, 100 Type-III phaser rifles, 75 sets of body armor, 120
Anastazine gas grenades, 120 concussion grenades, and 120 photon
grenades. Access to the armory is highly restricted. Only the ship's CO,
XO, Department Heads, and the Security staff have access to the armory,
and this is granted only after a DNA palm print scan. The armory is laid
out in racks, each labelled and catalogued. Inventory of armory and
weapons lockers contents is taken at the beginning of each duty shift
and compared to a master readout contained within a secure section of
the main library database. The armory is continually manned by a pair of
security officers.

To protect against a hostile boarding of the ship, there are also
several weapons lockers strategically placed in prominent areas of the
ship. These areas include the Auxiliary Control, Bridge, Brig, Main
Engineering, Transporter Rooms, the Shuttlebay, and the Torpedo Room.
During normal operations, only the Command and Security staff (as stated
for the armory) may gain access to the lockers. During yellow or red
alert status, any ship's crew member may gain access via DNA thumb print
verification. Each locker contains 12 Type-II hand phasers, two
tricorders and twenty four spare power packs with an effective life of
forty five maximum setting shots each. The combined arms of the weapons
lockers and armory are sufficient to supply every crew member

### Brig {.title}

Located on Deck 10, the Brig is comprised of five cells, a common watch
area and COS' office. The watch area is nothing more than a duty station
in which a security officer can stand watch over the prisoners. Each
cell is equipped with a small drum dispenser for the secure transfer of
items and food to and from the cell. The drum has an opening on only one
section of its curved surface, and is made out of a 1cm thick sheet of
duranium alloy, which in turn is mounted to a framework of solid
duranium that extends 25.0cm within the bulkhead of the wall. Once an
object is placed with in the drum, it is rotated so that its opened
section faces into the cell. For reasons of security, the controls for
the drum dispenser are placed on the watch duty station and not within
the detention cell itself. This is to prevent a prisoner from escaping
his cell by using the drum dispenser to gain access to his cell
controls. There is a single protein resequencer mounted near the watch
duty station and is totally inaccessible to cell occupants.

The protein resequencer is capable of transforming bulk protein into a
variety of simple chain food stuffs such as ice cream, meats and
potatoes. The cells themselves utilize a series of two recessed
forcefield generators which deliver a painful, but relatively harmless
shock to anyone who touches the field whilst active. When activated, the
generators slide into place and glow with a soft yellow light. This
allows the watch officer to continually monitor the cells occupants
without allowing an opportunity to escape.

Also housed in the Brig is the ship's vault. The vault is a secured
storage compartment which can be used to safely store information and
evidence in criminal investigations, sensitive mission specific
material, information that cannot be stored in the ship's cargo bay or
computers, currency, or personal items for the crew and passengers. The
vault is separated into a safe and 100 locked boxes. Either the safe or
the boxes can be individually preset to its own lock combination and
climate controls. Access to the vault is granted only by senior officer
identification. This identification is verified by voice print, optical
retina scan, and palm print. All three must be successful for the senior
officer to gain access to the vault.

### Main Engineering {.title}

Main Engineering is located near the centre of the secondary hull on
Decks 11 and 12. At either end of the compartment is a single three man
turbolift which only operates within Main Engineering. The warp core
lays horizontally along the floor of Deck 12, fore to aft, separated
from the main engineering bay by a series of walkways, plasma transfer
pipes and water exchange junctions.

Occupying the entire rear half of these two decks, Main Engineering is
the second biggest single area on the ship. Plasma transfer conduits,
optical data conduits, water transfer pipes and deuterium exchange lines
occupy the majority of the floor space, requiring work terminals and the
bulk of all engineering functions to be raised on walkways, crawlspaces
and platforms. The two primary and one auxiliary deuterium storage tanks
are mounted along the starboard wall behind the warp core. The
antimatter storage tanks are similarly mounted along the port wall.

The Chief Engineer's station and primary monitoring systems for
engineering are located on a raised level platform at the centre of the
deck. The engineering platform contains stations for monitoring all
primary and secondary systems as well as the warp core status monitor.
The Chief Engineer's station contains a bank of five screens mounted on
the plasma conduits that feed them, providing customizable readouts for
any of the ships systems as well as a computer access terminal and a
diagnostics panel.

### Science Lab {.title}

The Kurztman class, though not a science vessel by design, nonetheless
contains a small simple science lab for the general area of scientific
study. This lab, complete with the Chief Science Officer's office inside
is located on deck 4 next to the ship's galley.

Utility Systems {.title}
---------------

### Cargo Bays {.title}

The main cargo bays are located in the lower aft section of the
secondary hull, above the shuttlebay and behind the main deflector dish.
There are four cargo holds in total. Each cargo bay is equipped with two
entrances, one opening towards outer space for offloading via work bee,
shuttlecraft, or space dock. The second entrance is a dual access
airlock opening into the ship's corridor. The airlock acts as a buffer
between the cargo hold and the rest of the ship. Each cargo hold is
compartmentalized, and can be configured to provide a H, K, L, M, N, or
N(2) environment for the safe storage of perishable cargo or to house
life forms that exist in terrestrial environments other than Class-M.
This design gives the ship the capability of storing perishable cargo or
housing life forms in their proper environment. A further three cargo
areas are located on decks 3 and 4 of the saucer section, with the same
outward facing loading airlock and the inner double airlock. The saucer
section cargo bays are used for storing spare parts for the impulse
systems and emergency damage control equipment for the saucer section.

### Tractor Beam Systems {.title}

There are two tractor beam projectors located fore and aft, the fore
emitter is located across the neck of the saucer section, the aft
emitter at the rear of the star drive. Effective range of the tractor
beams is 22,500km, depending on local relativistic and delta-v
conditions.

### Transporter Systems {.title}

There are a total of 4 transporters designed into the Kurtzman's deck
plan. There are two standard six pad transporters, one on deck 2
directly beneath the main bridge and one on deck 10 in the star drive.
In addition, there are two ten pad emergency transporters. One is
located within the saucer section on deck 3, and the other is positioned
within the secondary hull on deck 7. Ranges of the standard transporters
are 30,000km, while that of the emergency and cargo transporters are
only 11,250km respectively. The transport sequence aboard the Kurtzman
takes 6 seconds to complete. The emergency transporters, by design, are
outbound transport only because of the inability to target that many
individual comm signals at a single time.

### Turbolift Systems {.title}

There are 7 operational turbolifts. Turbolift-1 is located in the centre
of the Saucer Section and has access from Deck-1 of the Saucer all the
way to Deck-15 of the Secondary Hull. Turbolift-2 is also located in the
centre of the Saucer, parallel with Turbolift-1, and has access from
Deck-2 of the Saucer through Deck-12 of the Secondary Hull. Turbolifts-3
and 4 have access from Deck-3 through Deck-6 of the Saucer Section, and
are located port and starboard respectively. Turbolifts-5 and 6 are
located port and starboard of the centre of the secondary hull and
traverse from deck-9 to deck-12. Turbolift-7 is a cargo turbolift. It is
located in the aft section of the Saucer and has access from Deck-3
through Deck-12 of the Secondary Hull, and can traverse to each of the
three main Cargo Holds as well as each of the secondary cargo bays
located in the saucer section. Each of the turbolifts is capable of
traversing horizontally as it approaches the secondary hull. The
horizontal shafts attached to each deck allow a turbolift to grant
access to every deck without the need to use more than a single lift.
With the exception of turbolift one, which is dedicated solely to
servicing the Bridge, every other turbolift operates on computer
controlled schedules that allow them to operate without a collision.
This can occasionally lead to delay times whilst one lift waits for
another to clear a shaft.

Crew Support Systems {.title}
--------------------

### Crew Quarters {.title}

Enlisted Crewmen and Junior Officers are billeted in pairs, each sharing
a small common lounge area and bathing facilities with separate bunk
areas. The lounge is equipped with a dining booth module and a work
station that can double as an entertainment centre. The bathroom is
equipped with a sink, toilet, and shower. The crewmen each receive a
bunk within their own separate area. This area consists of a small
closet, single bunk style bed and a small chest of drawers. Senior
Officers fare slightly better in that they do not have to share their
living space. Despite this, their stateroom, sleeping arrangement, and
bathing facilities are of the same design as the other Junior Officers.
The Captain, Executive Officer, and visiting VIPs fare much better. Each
has a dining module roughly 25% larger then the junior officers, a
bathroom with a whirlpool bath, shower, and a bedroom large enough for a
walk-in closet, a full sized bed, and a large work/entertainment
station. Only the Captain, Executive Officer, and V.I.P. quarters are
outfitted with food dispensers similar to the ones found in either of
the crew lounges. The Captain's quarters include a computer access
terminal.

### Crew Recreational Facilities {.title}

There are two crew lounges - one located in the forward most part of the
saucer section on Deck 5 and one just forward of Main Engineering on
Deck 10. Each lounge is capable of seating one hundred people at any
given time in some good comfort. Under usual conditions, there is a
movie shown on the large display screen twice a week for the crew's
enjoyment in each lounge, although programming is subject to Captains
discretion. Also located in the Lounge is a well stocked and fully
equipped games locker. The default game supplies include a wide range of
portable table top games for the crew to use at their leisure. The
locker may be stocked with such games as Three Dimensional Chess,
Battleships, Kal-toh, Three Dimensional Scrabble, Monopoly: the
Federation Edition, and several decks of cards in varying cultural
styles.

There is a private mess for receiving VIPs and hosting senior officers
located on deck 2, though its use is largely dependent upon the Captain
of the day. This dining area has a separate galley preparation area and
an entertainment screen suitable for displaying broadcasts of many
types. The private dining area is capable of seating fifteen comfortably
and is generally staffed by the Captain’s personal steward, two
under-stewards and two sous chefs.

### Gymnasium {.title}

There is a large gymnasium located on the lower aft section of Deck 6.
It is equipped with a sparring ring for boxing/wrestling/fencing or
other forms of hand to hand combat and cardiovascular and weights
machinery to keep the crew in peak physical condition. Should the
situation arise, the Gymnasium's equipment can be easily stored, thus
opening up the room's area to be used as an auditorium or act as an
auxiliary storage room or stage area for theatre performances. At any
given time, the gymnasium can comfortably contain forty people, though
in theatre configuration it can easily handle eighty, the standard off
duty complement at any given time.

### Galley {.title}

Located near the centre of deck 4 is the ship's galley. Although capable
of reproducing a variety of food selections, the Kurtzman Class is
equipped with both a food synthesizer system, and a fully functioning
Galley. Food stuffs for the Galley are stored in three separate fully
compartmentalized pantries, each compartment equipped with their own
stasis field generators to preserve freshness. This provides something
of an alternative to the standard cubed nutritional supplements offered
by the food synthesizer system.

The food synthesizer system is comprised of a matter re-sequencer system
connected to the waste reclamation system. The matter re-sequencer
recycles biological waste materials into simple protein and sucrose
compounds in taste similar to meat/ dairy/ vegetable by-products such as
ground beef, fish or poultry, cheeses, fruit juices and preserves but in
appearance simple multicolored cubes. Although highly efficient, the
re-sequencer is incapable of creating food stuffs with a complex layered
formation as found in a turkey leg (with fat, bone and skin attached to
the meat), or the fibrous consistency of fresh fruits and vegetables.

Galley prepared or processed synthesized food stuffs are distributed via
a computer controlled network of food dispensers. Any materials left
over from the meal such as the dinner ware, or undigested food stuffs
placed back into the dispenser are automatically recycled into the waste
reclamation system. Each dispenser consists of a closed circuit micro
transporter mounted as an enclosed wall unit in specified areas through
out the ship. These areas include: the Brig, the crew lounge, the
Captains, XO's, and VIP's quarters, Main Engineering, Sickbay, and the
Shuttlebay.

### Medical Facilities {.title}

The ship's Sickbay is located on deck 5, next to the primary computer
core in the centre of the saucer section, and is the most highly
protected section of the ship. Sickbay comprises two examination rooms
separated by a surgical room, which in turn is also bordered by a
recovery room. Each area is separated by bulkhead walls with a common
entrance leading from each to the main reception area. The reception
area is outfitted with a nurse's station. The nurse's station contains a
bank of monitors and panels along the rear wall which provide patient
information readouts as well as recall databases for medical files. This
station is separated from the reception area by a half moon desk at
which the supervising nurses work and greet new arrivals.

Each examination room is outfitted with nine biobeds. The surgical room
is outfitted with two biobeds, which are in turn modified specifically
for delicate surgical procedures. The recovery room is outfitted with
twelve bio beds that are designed more for a patient's comfort and
recovery. In addition, there is an emergency aid station located on
every deck near the turbolift entrance. Each aid station is nothing more
then an equipment locker housing three gurneys, and two fully stocked
emergency first aid kits.

The Chief Medical Officer's office is located between the two main
examination rooms. It consists of a small laboratory setup for testing
as well as a chemical synthesizer unit capable of producing almost any
form of base chemical compound with a ready library of almost all
current medicinal products available throughout the Federation. The CMO
also has a desk with communications panel, computer access terminal and
a series of screens across the wall above it which provides visual feeds
to the examination and recovery rooms.

Auxiliary Spacecraft Systems {.title}
----------------------------

### Shuttlebay {.title}

The shuttlecraft bay is located aft of the secondary hull and occupies
the entirety of decks 13, 14 and 15. Despite being an almost entirely
open space, these three decks are broken into a number of distinct
levels.

The upper level contains spare parts storage for all shuttle maintenance
in four suspended warehouses. Each warehouse contains a series of crane
units that can retrieve any stored part after a request is input into
the terminal outside each warehouse. Any large or unmanageable parts can
be moved directly to shuttle storage bays by the crane units. This area
is separated from the one below it by a large walkway grille and access
is granted by an open personnel lift from the landing bay level only.

This walkway also grants access to the main Shuttlebay control room,
which is suspended between the warehouses at the rear of the shuttlebay.
The control room is lined with portal windows facing forwards, providing
a panoramic view of the entire shuttlebay and launch doors. Within the
control room, a bank of five command and control stations is used to
manage both air and crane traffic. These are permanently manned by
senior technicians and are overseen by the Flight Control Officer who
reports directly to the First Officer.

The second level is broken into two sections. Pylon platforms are
constructed along the sides of the shuttlebay to store shuttles when not
actively flying. Access to these is granted by a series of dedicated
walkways and open air personnel lifts along the inner hull. The centre
of the space is taken up by the landing and launch lanes. Each bay
contains a work maintenance area to facilitate external maintenance of
removable parts. When launching, shuttles are used in rotation, the
lower platforms rolling into launch position on the runway. In the case
of upper platforms, the entire storage platform is lowered to the open
platform beneath it and rolled into position in the same manner via
antigravity cranes.

When landing, the shuttle comes to rest on an open platform at the end
of the runway and is rolled back into an open position either on the
lower or upper storage deck.

The shuttlebay launch doors occupy the entire rear hull plates of the
star drive and comprise two separate units. The outer shuttlebay doors
(the outer hull section) are withdrawn upwards into a dedicated space
between the primary and secondary hulls. The segmented inner doors then
retract horizontally, withdrawing along the back wall of the shuttlebay.
Atmospheric shields engage when the inner doors are withdrawn, allowing
environmental integrity to be maintained.

The shuttlebay is capable of launching two shuttlecraft at a time, but
can not accept landings whilst launches are in progress.

Conclusion {.title}
----------

With the arrival and deployment of the Kurtzman Class Battlecruisers, it
is the hope of Starfleet Command that no repeat of the Nero incident
ever take place again. Should there be such a danger, it is deemed
essential that ships designed specifically for the pursuit of warfare as
mobile weapons platforms be available for rapid deployment as the
vanguard of an offensive fleet.
