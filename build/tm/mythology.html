        <p>In the early days of 2383, there were those in Starfleet, mostly in the Exploratory Division, who foresaw what was now becoming a new 'Golden Age of Exploration' for the Federation and its allies. Because of this there was an obvious need for a new multi-purpose deep space explorer, one that would recall the earliest values of the Federation.</p>
        <p>The designers decided upon a large ship platform that would house some of the finest sensors, warp engines, and shield systems that were offered during and after the Dominion War. At the same time these designers gave the ship ample weapons to defend itself in its missions of exploration and diplomacy. Finally, the designers built into the class many redundant and resilient systems, as well as expanded work areas to increase its endurance when far from Federation space. The designers hoped in later years that this design would replace the older Excelsior and Ambassador Class vessels in the fleet. They also intended it to be an alternate design to the proven Galaxy and Viking class explorers.</p>
        <p>However, as design work continued into the ending months of 2386, an alliance was forged between the Federation and the newly discovered Flea'tan Alliance. A technology exchange occurred between the two powers, and several ship design workers of the Alliance came to assist in the design of this and several other new classes. Once brought up to speed on how ship design work of Federation technology functioned, they began inputting their own technologies and ideas into the new vessel's framework. To this co-operative design came a new deep space explorer of a kind unseen since Starfleet's earliest days of co-operative expansion.</p>
        <p>As a year passed with final design work, June of 2387 finally heralded the first prototype to come out of the Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards. The USS Mythology NX-98711 was given over to Starfleet Command for full review and approval. Finding such a well stocked vessel able to fit many core mission profiles Starfleet Command in the final months of 2387 gave the approval for the official construction of the Mythology class deep space explorer.</p>

          <p>Due to its large size and self reliance, the Mythology class is well suited to the following mission profiles:</p>

            <li class=" member">First contact with new races and entities</li>

          <p>With inclusion of its mission modules the Mythology has further expanded profiles:</p>

        <p>The Mythology class is a large ship platform spanning 45 decks. Its saucer begins in an inset teardrop and angles out and back into a half oval near the rear. A thick, wide neck connects it seamlessly in an angled slope to the engineering hull. This hull section is like the top of a tear drop at the front, only to angle back near the aft section to a square broad base. The warp nacelles are mounted to the aft section of the engineering hull.</p>
        <p>The warp nacelles are positioned on short variable struts that enable the nacelles to project from the engineering hull in an upward 90 degree arc. The designers kept them as close as possible to the main space frame to reduce its profile were combat to occur, while at the same time allowing enough room for the nearby mission module docking areas to be easily swapped as needed.</p>
        <p>To further specify, decks 1 through 20 are in the saucer; 21 through 45 form the engineering hull.</p>
        <p>The hull structure of the Mythology is composed of a 75 / 25 mixture duranium / tritanium alloy double layered hull inset with hardened duranium fillings. The design was then transporter welded along the whole superstructure. Finally, the hull was covered with high density duranium alloy, with composite duranium plastic sheets, measuring 5.0 cm thick as a secondary layer of protection.</p>

          <p>The Mythology class has three mission module swap areas. The first is located aft of the bridge and below on an angle from shuttle bay 1 on decks 5 through 8; the other two are located in the engineering hull. They are placed on the lower aft port and starboard areas of the connecting structure on decks 30 through 33. These modules are easily hot swapped out at any star base that has such facilities. Typical swap over times range from 3 to 5 days. When a particular module suite is chosen by the Captain and Command officers for the mission ahead all three bays are used.</p>
          <p>The available modules are as follows:</p>

          <p>The Mythology houses the Class 10 sensor system. This system design layout gained high praise by scientists and tactical minded designers alike during the later stages of the Dominion War for its reliability and ease of use over older systems and design set-ups. The system has a maximum high resolution range out to 5.0 light years, and a low resolution range out to 17.0 light years. The system has built in redundancies that allow it to function at varying reduced levels if damage occurs, far above presently fielded designs. The sensor pallets are arranged in circular clusters along the lines of the saucer and in square clusters along the sides ventral and dorsal of the engineering hull. The main deflector itself is located along decks 30 through 33 in the engineering hull.</p>

          <p>The Mythology comes equipped with three computer cores. The primary and secondary cores were enhanced with bio-neural processing circuity to speed up response times. The third core is solely made up of standard isolinear data storage chips and processors. The primary core is located on decks 8 through 11. The secondary core is located on decks 30 through 33. The backup core is located in the aft section of the neck areas of the engineering hull, on decks 23 through 25.</p>
          <p>In normal operations the combination core in the saucer handles all primary ship operations; the second combination core handles any further demands in normal operations as the need arises. Only when both cores are damaged or offline does the tertiary core come online. When in operation, it can only run critical ship systems such as life support, engines, basic sensors, manual limited weapon targeting and navigation.</p>
          <p>The Mythology uses bio-neural circuitry for all primary systems and a back up isolinear network for secondary systems during normal operations. To further improve its redundancy and survival capabilities, the back up isolinear network is able to operate critical primary systems if the bio-neural circuitry is compromised or damaged. To aid in preventing infections the bio-neural circuitry uses the I-MUN Mark II filter series.</p>
          <p>The combination cores use the LCARS OS using the MAJEL interface. The saucer and engineering hull cores house UHPAVS (Upgraded Hacking Prevention and Anti Virus Scanner), as well as RSUEP (Really Stupid User Error Prevention) data programs. However, the standard isolinear backup core lacks this feature, as well as the more advanced functions of the MAJEL interface. Captains commanding these ships are strongly warned to keep genius inebriated adolescents, high risk crew members or visitors away from consoles in such an emergency. During use of specialized mission modules, the engineering hull combination computer core handles all functions of the mission modules.</p>

This allows the ship's two EMH Mark IV programs to appear in these areas besides the sickbays, holodecks and holosuites. The EMH Mark IV programs are located in both the primary and secondary computer cores. This allows two programs to be active at any given time.</p>

        <p>Given the ships large size, and the designers plans to give the Mythology class the most self reliance and sufficiency capable for long deep space missions, it is equipped with the Class 10 warp core. The core was retrofitted for ease of use and maintenance for long term missions far from Federation supply and refitting yards.</p>
        <p>This core feeds two nacelles, outputting 7,912 cocharanes, giving the Mythology a standard cruising speed of warp 6.8, a max sustainable speed of warp 9.6, a maximum velocity for twelve hours of warp 9.98, and an emergency speed of warp 9.99. Due to its larger than usual size and power demands, the ship is slower than others that would mount the Class 10 core.</p>
        <p>The nacelles are mounted on variable pylons, which also house their support systems. As with much of the ship they contain reinforced superstructure, and both primary and secondary warp coils.</p>

Two small auxiliary panels to either side of these spots can be configured for use as needed for mission specific guests.</p>
          <p>A guide rail circles down the middle area of the bridge. Just forward of the railing from port to starboard are the Executive Officer, Captain, Counselor and two mission specialist chairs. Handy flip up consoles give critical data access to each officer and guest. In the right arm rest of the Captain's chair is a flip up holder which contains a clip for a type 2 phaser. An optional hat, jacket or trophy rack, depending on the Captain's preference, connects to a front baseboard of the tactical and security consoles. Along the starboard wall of the bridge are the Helm and 2nd officers stations and directly across on the port wall are the Chief Science Officers and Chief Engineers bridge stations.</p>
          <p>At the front of the bridge is the view screen. On either side of this are two science related holo projector units allowing 3-D views of interesting objects to be shown. The bridge has three turbo lifts: two forward, one port and starboard of the view screen and one aft starboard. Along various console edges and other places that could cause injuries during stumbles or falls is 2.5 cm of soft foam padding.</p>

          <p>Though not normally meant to house combat prisoners or other large scale groups of trouble makers, the Mythology nonetheless has four holding cells. Each area can house five occupants comfortably or ten if comfort room is not a concern. Two of these facilities are located on deck 10 port and starboard in the saucer section. Two more are located on deck 40 port and starboard. As a strict precaution in case of power loss, the cells have an emergency five hour generator to prevent prisoner escape. In addition each cell guard is armed with a Type 2 phaser set to wide heavy stun under normal operating conditions.</p>

          <p>Main engineering runs along almost all of the central part of decks 40 to 42 with support areas along the lower reaches of decks 43 in these same areas. The warp core raises the full height of engineering on decks 40 to 42. The Chief Engineers office is located on the main work area of deck 41 facing the core. From here the officer can oversee all power functions, status of repairs and engineering teams under their charge.</p>
          <p>Core ejection systems for the core and antimatter pods lead up a chute out the top of the engineering hull. As an extreme back up precaution, there is a manual release system at the top of the core which will engage the pressurized ejection systems, launching the core out of the hull via a pneumatic pump system. This can be utilized in a situation where the power required for the automatic ejection system fails, though use of this system is a last measure, and carries a high risk of injury to the crew member who engages it, owing to the risk of explosive gases released.</p>
          <p>Also contained here is the much smaller Flea'tan Compression Relay Jump Core module: this two deck module aligns itself to the rear of the Class X warp core on decks 40 and 41.</p>
          <p>Monitoring systems and consoles for each power source are also aligned in a square around this whole double decked oval shaped room.</p>
          <p>In an emergency this area can be converted into a secondary bridge.</p>

        <p>The Mythology class is one of the largest deep space exploration classes fielded by the Federation in recent years. It is designed to handle any number of possible mission profiles, but does not specialize in any one category. Its primary assets are adaptability, endurance and survivability where other ships may not be able to venture. With its co-designed construction the Mythology embodies the best that the Federation and her allies have to offer for the years ahead.</p>
