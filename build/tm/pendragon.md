History and Mission Overview {.title}
----------------------------

"Everything begins somewhere, although many physicists disagree."

—Terry Pratchett

Following the end of the Cardassian War, and the Borg invasions of the
late 2360s, Star Fleet and the Federation Council decided that it would
be in the Federation's best interests to create a craft capable of
defending Federation space from external threats. Until this point, the
Federation hadn't developed combat vessels as a matter of principal.
However, the repeated arising of new threats to the Federation forced
the Council to re-evaluate this viewpoint.

Out of this ship evaluation and modernization program would be the
Pendragon class. The project was assigned to Starfleet's Avalon
Shipyards. For the next 11 some years, a group of Avalon researchers,
developers and designers would slave away in a dark chamber in the heart
of Avalon's Research and Development complex creating the next
generation warship for Starfleet.

Finally on June 5, 2377 the project ship was delivered to Starfleet
testing grounds for final inspection. The ship was sent through all the
standard Starfleet tests and passed with flying colours. High praise was
given to the ship for its sturdiness, and long-range capability's. The
end result of the project, the USS Pendragon, was commissioned with the
registration NCC-86271.

The Pendragon-Class Battlecruiser is designed to provide military
superiority in unstable regions. As such, it is well armed and self
reliant, capable of handling most military situations short of fleet
battle. However, as Star Fleet appears to be taking on the role of
galactic police officer the Pendragon class is fitted for diplomatic
purposes to hopefully stop conflict as it starts.

When the Pendragon is in a Fleet/Task force situation the firepower,
manoeuvrability, and size of the Pendragon makes its role in the
battlefield are less defined then that of destroyers and dreadnoughts.
As a result, the Pendragon is capable of many different combat roles, a
sample of which are listed here:

-   Frontline combat
-   Support of frontline vessels
-   Flank Attack
-   Rapid Response to Threat vessels
-   Fleet Command
-   High Security Prisoner transport

Structure and Construction {.title}
--------------------------

"She can rebuild you. She has the technology."

—The Metatron

The Pendragon, despite being a combat vessel, resembles the more common
exploration cruiser except for the fact it is heavily armed. The saucer
section itself is circular, with the engineering hull blending out of
it. Fixed off each side of the engineering hull there is a set of warp
nacelle pylons.

The Pendragon utilizes a series of interlocking tritanium/duranium truss
frames for its space frame construction. Instead of gamma wave welding,
the Pendragon Project ship and all ships of its class used [Transporter
Welding](transporterwelding.html "Transporter Welding") to create
stronger joints compared to traditional construction methods.

Furthermore, the Pendragon's hull is completely covered with 8 cm of
enhanced Tritanium armour. This armour can easily resist fire from type
8 phasers in most areas where there is enough structural backing to
support the armour. This is further reinforced with an additional 4-cm
layer of ablative armour covering allowing an evenly distributed level
of protection along most of the hull.

These ablative inserts can be found on areas including,

-   Most of the warp nacelles
-   All of the bridge structure
-   Space lock openings
-   Protected vents
-   Protective sensor plates
-   Window coverings
-   Shuttle bay doors
-   Areas where normal armour cannot effectively protect to full due to
    the need for structural support behind it.

Further use of enhanced Tritanium armour is made with in the ship to
protect the crew from attacks that pierce the armoured hull. This
includes 5-cm armour inserts in most walls, ceiling and floors between
10 and 20 meters from the hull. Walls protected in such a manner can
resist type V phaser fire with ease, and prevent key locations on the
ship from being destroyed by powerful shot piercing through the hull.

Key points of the ship are further armoured with enhanced Tritaniuml
including (but not limited to)

-   Bridge
-   Engineering
-   Structural integrity field and inertial dampening field generators
-   Armoury
-   Sickbay
-   Matter and anti-matter fuel storage
-   Torpedo magazines
-   Torpedo bays

Science and Remote Sensing Systems {.title}
----------------------------------

"I believe it is my god-given right to destroy everything in my sight!"

—The Offspring, "One Fine Day"

### Computer Systems {.title}

The Pendragon is equipped with 3 military orientated science labs on
deck 4 that are capable of handling the basic science needs of any
federation ship. These can easily function as evidence testing and
analysis labs for criminal justice use. There is also a basic stellar
cartography lab on the same deck as the science labs.

The Pendragon utilizes three computer cores, and backed by a series of
bio-neural gel-packs. Each core is capable of handling all the functions
of the ship, so the three cores provide 100% redundancy. Should the ship
be required to run with just one core active, there will be no
interruptions, although some secondary and recreation functions may be
suspended. Cooling of each core is handled by liquid nitrogen loops,
with incorporated delayed-venting heat storage blocks for stealth
operations.

Because all three of the computer cores are isolinear-based systems, the
tried and true LCARS operating system program was used for the base
operating system. Some new features were added to the old LCARS
operating system to provide for some of the special needs of a combat
vessel. These new features include better tactical recognition and
targeting systems, faster sensor sweep protocols and the addition of
sentinel programs to the security matrix.

Bio-neural gel-packs are used for optimum response times and data
handling efficiency. Networks of bio-gel packs are distributed
throughout the ship. A total of 420 bio-gel packs assist with the
function of the ship and systems. In the event of total core shutdown,
the bio-gel packs take over all the basic functions of the ship.

### Sensory Systems {.title}

The Pendragon is equipped with standard sensor packages. Some of these
are behind the main deflector, while others are placed in sensor pallet
arrays. They can be upgraded through time as deemed necessary. Sensor
are attached to shock protective mountings, and protected by articulated
hull plating. The only time a sensor is fully exposed is when running
deep in-depth scans. In addition, the Pendragon is equipped with
Emissions Tracking System units for improved targeting during combat.

The Pendragon carries a selection of scientific probes, which can be
restocked at any star base, or built in its [Machine
Shop](machineshop.html "Machine Shop").

### Holographic Crew Members {.title}

Sickbay is equipped with two EMH mark IV systems for use if needed, as
described below.

Warp Propulsion Systems {.title}
-----------------------

"Push the little red button."

—Agent K

 Warp Core 
:   1500 Cochrane Warp Core

 Max. Sustainable Warp 
:   9.3

 Emergency Warp 
:   9.7 (12 hours)

 Cruising Speed 
:   Warp 6.0

The Warp Propulsion System (WPS) of the Pendragon-Class Battlecruiser
consists of three major components: the Matter/Anti-Matter reaction
assembly, the power transfer conduits, and the two warp engine nacelles.
Specifications sent to Avalon called for the Pendragon to be able to
maintain a normal cruise speed of Warp 6.0 until fuel exhaustion, a
maximum cruise of Warp 9.3, and an emergency warp speed of Warp 9.7
sustainable for 12 hours To achieve this the ship uses warp nacelles
designed to prevent the subspace distortion effect present in old warp
propulsion systems.

The Pendragon has 30 standard anti-matter storage tanks, allowing a
Pendragon-Class Battlecruiser an operational life of approximately five
to seven years before fuel exhaustion. Deuterium tanks are located in
the star drive hull, and can be access for refuelling via aperture. The
tanks hold a sufficient amount of deuterium to allow for a five-year
mission life under normal operational conditions.

Impulse Propulsion Systems {.title}
--------------------------

"Faster. Must go faster."

—David Levison

The Impulse Propulsion Systems (IPS) handles the primary sub light
propulsion of the ship and certain power generation. The Pendragon has
two impulse engines located in the saucer hull. The Deuterium tanks
provide fuel for the impulse drives. Due to relativity and fuel
constraints, that can cause major computer malfunctions, the ship is
never taken faster the .27c.

The Pendragon has a rapid rate of acceleration and deceleration.
However, the ship is incapable of the sharp turns that characterise some
smaller vessels. As such, it is not recommend that Pendragons be sent to
areas requiring this ability, such as the Badlands.

Tactical Systems {.title}
----------------

"Death to the Opposition!"

—Favourite Baseball chat of Klingon baseball fans everywhere

### Shield Systems {.title}

The shields of the Pendragon were made slightly tighter than usual in
order to save as much power as possible. In addition, the Pendragon is
equipped with a series of back-up shield emitters designed to protect
the Bridge, deflector array, warp nacelles and weapon systems. These
only provide protection to these locations, not to the entire ship.
These shields are only activated should the main shields fail.

 Maximum Gravitational Load 
:   2700 megawatts

 Maximum Energy Dissipation Rate 
:   7.9 x 10\^5 kilowatts

### Phaser Systems {.title}

Phaser systems were incorporated to allow the ship to fire in any
direction, although the most effective firepower is found to the front
of the vessel. The recharge rate for each phaser bank is less then or
equal to .4 seconds. Phaser emitters are optimised to produce an output
on 5.1 MW while still being able to maintain a full power for 1.5 hours
due in part to a massive reworking of the coolant systems and power
supply systems.

-   4 Type-X Phaser Banks, each with 190 emitters, mounted on the saucer
    section.
-   4 Type-X Phaser Banks, with a total of 280 emitters, mounted on the
    star drive section.

### Torpedo Systems {.title}

The Pendragon has a forward facing pair of these torpedo tubes on either
side of the main defector dish, and another pair of rear facing tubes is
mounted near the end of the star drive hull. These torpedo launcher can
each load, burst fire 4 star fleet standard torpedoes, and reset the
torpedo tube for another load in 15 second flat. Up to 8 torpedoes can
be loaded into a torpedo tube at one time but the loading of the 4 extra
torpedoes requires a extra 10 seconds to torpedo fire procedure.

All Pendragon Battlecruiser carries a ratio of 100 Quantum torpedoes,
500 Photon torpedoes, and over 100 sensor probes in their torpedo
magazines.

### Self-Destruct {.title}

The Pendragon-Class carries a complete self-destruct system, intended to
leave no remains of the ship. The main features of this are 42 rings of
detonators and safety interlock release systems on the
matter/anti-matter storage units.

Command and Support Systems {.title}
---------------------------

"Of Course! The reverse switch!"

—Primacron

The Pendragon-Class Battlecruiser includes all standard EPS, fluid
transfer, ODN lines, atmospheric, and other energetic or consumable
systems. EPS conduits and ODN fibre bundles are reinforced to protect
against damage in battle and tactically placed to prevent rupture due to
internal phaser fire. Jefferies Tubes provide access to all major
systems. Turbolifts are used to connect all areas of the ship. Auxiliary
power is provided by a series of power generators located around the
ship. These will power most systems on-board the ship.

### Bridge {.title}

The Bridge is found on Deck 1. The Captain's chair is in the centre of
the Bridge. To the Captain's right is the XO's chair. A third chair is
found to the Captain's left for use if needed. Conn and Ops stations are
in front of the Captain. Primary Tactical Control is behind the Captain;
a Security Station is behind this to relieve the workload of Tactical
Officers. The Engineering Station (found next to the Security Station)
is large enough to accommodate two Engineers at any time, and offers
extensive control over engineering systems. A science station is also
present.

### Battle Bridge {.title}

A Battle Bridge is on Deck 7. This has a single command seat plus conn,
ops, tactical and engineering stations.

### War Room {.title}

A War Room is found on Deck 1, adjacent to the Bridge. As well as
allowing co-ordination between fleet elements and planning for fleet
operations, it will also serve as a Briefing Room for Command staff and
Department Heads.

### Main Engineering {.title}

In the event that both main and battle bridge become disabled, captured
or destroyed, Main Engineering is capable of serving as a bridge unit.
Workstations would be configured for Conn, Ops, Tactical, and other
command functions. Main Engineering is a two-deck facility, found on
Decks 12 and 11.

### Diplomatic Facilities {.title}

The Pendragon is equipped with basic diplomatic facilities on deck 4.
The Diplomatic areas on this deck only take up a small portion of the
ships area but provide enough room for basic negotiations. Food can be
cooked in the Mess hall and brought up if need. Most of the quarters on
this deck are dedicated diplomatic quarters and as such are a little
more lavish in their decor and set up. The diplomatic areas could be
quickly converted to command and tactical planning areas for the brass,
and Military Justice Division centres that serve out in the field.

### Armory {.title}

On deck 7 is where most of security resides. The armoury that is on this
deck is rather large and maintains a collection of federation phaser
capable of arming the whole crew and then some. Type 1, type 2, and type
3 phasers and their variations are kept here along with hazard, black
ops and marine armoured suits. Other systems that are kept here
including the uncommonly seen Type 4 squad cannon, TR-116 rifles,
Iso-magnetic Disintegrators and Tetryon Pulse Launchers. This area is of
course protected by a thick 5-cm layer of Hard Metal Type Armour capable
of protecting against most internal security breaches.

### Brig {.title}

The Brig resides on the other side of the deck from the armoury. There
are 10 cells here protected by force fields, transport inhibitors, and
5-cm layer of Hard Metal Type Armour over the walls around and in the
brig. Besides the force field guarded entry the only other opening in a
cell is a maintenance hatch in the ceiling that is protected by
electrostatic circuits.

### Phaser Range {.title}

A Phaser Practice Range is present in order to provide practice with
weaponry without using up more of the ship's resources than are
necessary.

### Departmental Offices {.title}

Each Department Head has his or her own office. These are located
together with the officer's respective sphere of influence (example: The
COS's office is between the Brig and armoury).

### Machine Shop {.title}

The Pendragon is equipped with a [Machine
Shop](machineshop.html "Machine Shop") area so to prolong its ability to
stay in the field. This area equipped with the basic versions of the
latest tools deemed necessary by star fleet to keep the Pendragon parts
in top condition due to normal wear and tear.

UItility Systems {.title}
----------------

"This way."

—Call

### Cargo Bays {.title}

Storage bays can be found though out the ship. These cargo bays are of
varying capacity and capacity. Some are equipped with cargo transporters
depending on the normal content and location of the cargo bay.

### Tractor Beam Systems {.title}

The Pendragon-Class is fitted with a Tractor Beam system as standard.
This is found immediately below the Deflector Array, with a maximum
range of 20,000km. Effective range is dependent on the mass of the
object being tractored.

### Transporter Systems {.title}

The Pendragon-Class has three pairs of transporter rooms. These are to
be found on decks 2, 10 and 16.

### Communication Systems {.title}

The Pendragon utilises RF and subspace communication packages common to
most, if not all, Star Fleet vessels. In addition, closed-band and
encoded transmission equipment is fitted to aid in Fleet Command and
Combat Group Manoeuvres.

Crew Support Systems {.title}
--------------------

"Unlimited technology from across the galaxy, and all we get is this
Ford POS."

—Agent J

### Environmental Systems {.title}

A de-centralized environmental system is used, allowing quarters to have
atmospheric conditions changed to suit the occupant and make it close to
impossible for life support to be knocked out by targeting a single
portion of the ship. These decentralized life support systems comprise
of gravity deck plating, and room based air filtration systems. Sickbay
and the cargo bays also have a wide degree of environmental flexibility
for the accommodation of refugees, specialized crops and aiding the
recovery of patients. As needed, all closed off rooms of the ship can be
set to Type M, H, K, and L environment conditions within a little as a
few minutes. Should one of the independent life support system fail
(however unlikely as it may be because of all the safe guards built into
the systems), main life support systems will take over.

### Recreational Facilities {.title}

The principal recreational facilities on the Pendragon are the
10-Forward (10-F) bar and lounge, popular amongst crewmembers looking to
relax. Replicators and found in 10-F and the Mess Hall for the use of
anyone on ship. These are significantly larger than those found in crew
quarters.

Additional recreational facilities consist of 2 holodecks, 6 holosuites.
Crewmembers can also participate in training exercises that can count as
field experiences towards promotions. The holodecks can also be used for
combat-training exercises. As with replicators, all holo-recreation
facilities shut down during red alert and can only be turned on during
such at time by a command officer.

In addition, to keep the crew in good health, there is small gym
facility. This includes a matted exercise area perfect for hand combat
training, practice (or ironing out crew members differences of
opinions), machine fitness room, and a military standard sized
basketball court. There is also a small steam room, and small hot tub
area between the locker rooms.

### Crew Quarters {.title}

The ship includes enough quarters to house the crew, plus some guests.
Although not large, crew quarters are space-efficient by nature.
Diplomatic and command quarters offer a significant improvement. Should
crewmembers need special quarter's arrangements; there is normally
enough flexibility in the Pendragon's set up to provide.

All quarters have personal replicators capable of replicating small
meals, beverages and small objects. The Mess hall and 10-Forward Lounge
are both equipped with high-volume replicators, which incorporate
imaging scanners for entering new meals, beverages and objects for
future replication. If needed, the captain can assign a replicator
ration system in crisis situations. Replicators go off line in red alert
situations, and can only be turned on during such at time by a command
level officer.

### Sickbay {.title}

The Pendragon's Sickbay is large and well equipped, with the intention
of returning crewmembers to duty as soon as possible. There are 4 main
joined areas with 10 beds and, surgical facilities in each area. The
main sickbay areas and labs are equipped with holo-emitters, personal
medical computer core, and four micro fusion generators. As such, up to
2 EMH programs can be run throughout sickbay, and only sickbay, at one
time. In addition to this, there are quarters already fitted as recovery
areas for medical usage, medical labs, and storage for additional
equipment and supplies in a special storage bay.

### Lifeboats {.title}

The Pendragon-Class is fitted with enough lifeboats to fully accommodate
the potential passenger capacity of the ship (passenger includes crew,
civilians and dignitaries). This ensures that no one is left behind if
the ship must be abandoned.

### Crew Complement {.title}

In addition to standard Department heads, the Pendragon may typically
carry a Chief Tactical Officer and/or Chief Intelligence Officer as a
long-term officer and members of the Judge Advocate General's office or
Diplomatic Officer on short-term missions.

Auxiliary Spacecraft Systems {.title}
----------------------------

"I'll get Oz. He has a van."

—Willow Rosenburg

The Pendragon has one shuttle bay, found on decks 10-12. The bay can
hold a total of 10 Armadillo-Class shuttlecraft.

To keep shuttlecraft and turbo lifts in peak condition; there is a
shuttle maintenance bay on deck 13-14. Shuttlecraft can be lowered from
the main shuttle bay or lifted from the make shift shuttle bays by
electro-hydraulic elevator landing pads. There is also an open- ended
turbo lift tunnel here allowing turbo lifts to be brought in for
maintenance.

Conclusion {.title}
----------

"Excuse Me."

—Slag

The USS Pendragon, and its sister ships, are heavily armed, armoured
frontline combat vessels. Scientific, diplomatic and recreational
facilities are minimal, although present. The USS Pendragon was
commissioned shortly after the Dominion War, and the class continues to
serve in heavy military, swift justice, and basic science and diplomatic
roles.
