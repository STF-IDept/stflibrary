        <p>As the Federation entered a new, yet tentative age of peace with the Klingons in the years that followed the Khitomer Accord, Star Fleet began to reassess the condition, inventory, and mission profile of its fleet.  Before that time, older designs such had been relegated to boarder patrol and training duties while newer, more capable designs slowly took over the role of deep space exploration.  As promised in the Khitomer Accord, Star Fleet began demilitarizing and dismantling the outpost network along the Klingon Neutral Zone, while at the same time reducing the size of its combat fleet.  Thus many ships of the old guard literally found themselves decommissioned over night.  Ironically, this practice created an even greater need for new ship construction.</p>
        <p>In 2295, Star Fleet Command initiated a directive for the construction of a new medium exploration cruiser design.  Several contractors were invited to participate in a bidding contest for the new class designation. A combination of speed, space frame durability, tactical effectiveness, and space exploration sciences were to be incorporated into the over all design. In the end it was the Salazaar Shipyards of Andoria that won the contract with their prototype, the USS Mariner.  After successful completion of the Mariner's shake down cruise, Star Fleet placed an order for a further 50 ships of the same class.  Though it was specifically designed as an exploration vessel, its mix of maneuverability, firepower, and Rodinium armor platting proved that the ship was a valuable tactical asset.</p>

        <p>In appearance, the Mariner is of a standard configuration.  The saucer section is attached to the secondary hull via a front dorsal neck mounting, while the twin warp nacelles are fitted to the aft section of the secondary hull via upward turned pylons.</p>
        <p>The majority of the Mariner's space frame is made up of pure titanium with three separate framed hull layers. Once the pluming and electrical systems were in place and covered by hull plating, titanium fiber enriched duroplast foam was pressure injected into the spaces between the hull layers for insulation and radiation shielding. The outer most hull has an additional 4.5 cm layer of homogeneously rolled rodinium armor plating. Rodinium, the hardest known substance in Federation Science, was until that time primarily used for shielding on static structures such as an orbital Outpost or Starbase.  Though its heavy mass prevents it from use in Starship structural components, it works well as a hull layer armoring against physical penetration or focused energy attacks. Upon completion, a nonreflecting thermo coat of battleship-grey was electro-magnetically bonded to the rodinium hull, giving the ship a dull finish.  On average, the over all hull thickness of a completed space frame is 30.0cm.</p>
        <p>During an extreme emergency, the saucer section was designed to be jettisoned from the secondary hull and act as a large life boat for the crew.  In such an occurrence, the impulse motor on the aft of the saucer section would act as the main propulsion drive and power generating plant.  Explosive bolts placed strategically along stress points with in the neck mount physically sever the saucer section from the secondary hull.  Once separated, the saucer can not be reattached to the secondary hull with out the services of a dry dock repair facility.  Maximum impulse speed of the Saucer section with the secondary hull jettisoned is 0.15 c.</p>

        <p>Along the hull of the ship are located a total of 135 sensors used for navigational, remote sensing, scientific, and tactical acquisition data collection. The sensory suite is designed for both active and passive data collection. In normal space flight operations, both methods are automatically employed simultaneously, though they can be reconfigured as active or passive only. Active sensory grids are echo collection devices that transmit a pulse signal, usually radio, optical, infrared, or subspace, and then interpret the rebounded signal in forms of cohesive data.  Passive sensory grids "listen" for physical and subspace signals that are given off by either a natural or artificial object.</p>
        <p>The sensory equipment installed on the Mariner Class has a high resolution range of approximately 2.5 light years, and 8.5 light years in low resolution.  Both figures are highly dependant on the current spatial conditions that the ship is experiencing. If the situation arises, the sensor grid can be used as an ECM device, effectively jamming most types of radio and subspace communications and navigational frequencies with decreasing effectiveness to a distance of 500,000km, depending on local relativistic conditions, though this will also render the ship's own subspace, and radio communication and navigational frequencies inoperable.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Mariner has on hand a usual complement of 25 pre-dedicated scientific probes, and another 25 empty torpedo casings ready for scientific or tactical augmentation.</p>

          <p>The Mariner is designed and built with a dual computer core system.  It is outfitted with an M-6 Duotronic primary core, and an M-2 Duotronic secondary core.  The primary core is located in the center of decks 3, 4, and 5 of the saucer section, with the smaller back up core in the center aft of the secondary hull in deck-12.  The function of the secondary core has largely been relocated to simple information back up storage.  In an emergency, it can be reconfigured to operate most of the Mariner's primary systems such as navigation, propulsion, weapons, and life support, though on a limited capacity.</p>

        <p>The Mariner utilizes a Class-VII warp core. It is similar to, but 25% smaller then the core designed for the Excelsior Class. To save space, the core is mounted horizontally along the centerline of the ship's Z-axis running for to aft with in the secondary hull.  The ejection protocols happen with in a 3 second time interval because of the sequences of explosive separation and ejection.  During a warp core breach, the core is ejected through a service hatch directly aft from the Mariner's secondary hull.  The warp core for the Mariner is rated at 900 cochranes with a max velocity of TOS-Warp-9.6 for 12 hours, a max sustainable velocity of TOS-Warp-8.5, and a cruising speed of TOS-Warp-5.5.</p>

          <p>The Mariner is outfitted with a mix of two separate phaser systems.  Being the primary phaser system, the Type-VIII's are typically mounted in the forward position with Type-VII's covering the broadsides and aft.  Both systems are designed to have independent firing control.  Regardless of Type, each phaser bank is equipped with its own fusion power pack which can be operated separate from the rest of the ship's systems, or they can draw their energy directly from the warp core via the main power couplings.  Each fusion power pack has a recharge rate of two hours, and can operate a phaser bank at full beam intensity for no longer then 15 seconds between recharging cycles.</p>
          <p>The Mariner has a total of six Type-VIII phaser emitters mounted in three separate banks of two.  Each bank covers a firing arc of 60 degrees azimuth and elevation.  One bank is located in the lower forward section of the saucer covering the forward arc while the second and third banks are on the upper saucer section covering the forward-port and forward-starboard arcs respectively.  Each of the Type-VIII emitters are rated for a maximum energy output of 2.6 MW at a range of 150,000 km.</p>
          <p>The Type-VII phaser emitters are also mounted in three separate banks of two, with a similar arc of 60 degrees azimuth and elevation coverage.  The first two banks are mounted on the underside of the saucer section, one facing port, and the second facing to starboard.  The third bank is mounted in the very aft section of the secondary hull just above the shuttlebay covering the aft firing arc.  Each of the Type-VII emitters are rated for a maximum energy output of 1.3 MW at a range of 75,000 km.</p>

          <p>The Mariner mounts a triple photon torpedo launcher system which takes up the entire space of Deck-8 inside the dorsal neck mount.  Two launchers are situated facing directly forward, while a third launcher is mounted to fire directly aft.  All three launchers are mounted in such a way as to allow independent launching of torpedoes.</p>
          <p>Because of developmental problems with a newer automatic photon torpedo loading system, it was decided to outfit the Mariner with the standard manually operated loading system.  This reduced the firing rate of the torpedoes, but greatly increased the accuracy of the launch along with a reduced probability of a torpedo misfire.  All three launchers are controlled from a single fire control room known as the "Torpedo Room", located on Deck-7 inside the dorsal neck mount.  The Torpedo Room is separated into two sections.  The first section handles the firing control and targeting of the photon torpedoes, while the second section is a maintenance area where the torpedoes can be maintained or reconfigured.  Also located on Deck-7 is the Torpedo Bunker, which is the main storage area for the usual complement of the 150 photon torpedoes, 25 scientific probes, and 25 empty torpedo casings.</p>
          <p>Each of the three torpedo launchers has a designed rate of fire of 8 torpedoes per minute with an effective range of 2,630,000 km.</p>

The "watch" area is nothing more then a duty station in which a security officer can stand watch over the prisoners. Each cell is equipped with a small "drum" dispenser for the secure transfer of items and food both to and from the cell.  The drum has an opening on only one section of its curved surface, and is made out of 0.5cm solid titanium, which in turn is mounted to a framework of solid titanium that extends 25.0cm with in the bulkhead of the wall.  Once an object is placed with in the drum, the drum is rotated so that its opened section "faces" the opposite side of the wall.  For reasons of security, the controls for the drum dispenser are placed on the "watch" duty station and not with in the detention cell itself.  This is to prevent a prisoner from escaping his cell by using the drum dispenser to gain access to his cell controls.  There is a single food dispenser mounted near the "watch" duty station and is totally inaccessible to cell occupants.</p>
          <p>Also housed in the Brig is the ship's vault. The vault is a secured storage compartment which can be used to safely store information and evidence in a criminal investigation, sensitive mission specific material or information that can not be stored in the ship's cargo bay or the ship's computers, currency, or personal items for the crew and passengers. The vault is separated into a safe, and 100 locked boxes. Either the safe or the boxes can be individually preset to its own lock combination and climate controls. Access to the vault is granted only by senior officer identification. This identification is verified by voice print, optical retina scan, and palm print.

The Chart Room is basically an interactive library in which astrophysical data is prioritized, catalogued, and studied for scientific, navigational, or tactical needs.  Although this room is designed as a navigational aid, its primary use is for the scientific study of interstellar objects.  In times of war, the Chart Room can be easily reconfigured as a War Room in the event that a ranking fleet officer should wish to use the ship as his flag ship during strategic operations.

          <p>The main cargo bays are located in the lower aft section of the Secondary Hull between the shuttlebays, and the main deflector dish. There are four cargo holds in total. Each cargo bay is equipped with two entrances, one opening towards outer space for offloading via work bee, shuttlecraft, or space dock.  The second entrance is a duel access airlock opening into the ship's corridor.  The airlock acts as a buffer between the cargo hold and the rest of the ship.  Each cargo hold is compartmentalized, and can be configured to provide either a H, K, L, M, N, or N(2) environment for the safe storage of perishable cargo or to house life forms that exist in other terrestrial environments other then Class-M. This design gives the ship the capability of storing perishable cargo or housing life forms in their proper environment.</p>

          <p>There are four tractor beam projectors located on the four outer corners of the space frame. Though they are meant for towing, they can be easily reconfigured as a repulser beam. In addition; the two aft tractor beams are designed to be able to tractor a damaged or escaping shuttle craft into the safety of the shuttlebay. All four tractor beam emitters are rigged so that an object can be "walked" into the desired position. For example: If a shuttlecraft is located foreword of the ship, the crewman manning OPS can lock onto the shuttle craft, and bring it far enough aft so that the aft tractor beams can haul it into the shuttlebay. Effective range of the tractor beams is 22,500km, depending on local relativistic conditions.</p>

          <p>Enlisted, NE, and Junior Officers are billeted in pairs, each sharing a small common lounge area and bathing facilities. The lounge is equipped with a dining booth module, and a work station that can double as an entertainment center. The bathroom is equipped with a sink, toilet, and a sonic shower. The crewmen each receive a separate bedroom which is only large enough for a twin bed, a dresser, and a small closet. Senior Officers fair slightly better in that they do not have to share their living space with another officer. But their stateroom, sleeping arrangement, and bathing facilities are of the same design as the Junior Officers. The Captain, Executive Officer, and visiting VIP's fair much better. Each has a dining module roughly 25% larger then the junior officers, a bathroom with a whirlpool bath/ sonic shower, and a bedroom large enough for a walk in closet, a full sized bed, and a large work/entertainment station. Only the Captain, Executive Officer, and V.I.P. quarters are outfitted with food dispensers similar to the ones found in either of the crew lounges.</p>

          <p>There are two crew lounges, the Forecastle, and the Fantail. The Forecastle Lounge is located in the forward most part of the saucer section on Deck-5.  This is usually considered as the Junior Officer, Enlisted and NE ranks lounge. Under usual conditions, there is a movie shown on the large display screen twice a week for the crew's enjoyment, although programming is subject to Captain's discretion.  Also located in the Forecastle Lounge is a well stocked and fully equipped game locker.  Stocked inside is a wide range of portable table top games for the crew to use at their leisure.   The locker may be stocked with such games as three dimensional chess, holo-battleship, and Fizbit.</p>
          <p>The Fantail lounge is located on the aft most section of Deck-6.  It is smaller, and has a minor increase in creature comforts when compared to the Forecastle.  As such, it is usually considered as the command staff and VIP lounge.</p>

          <p>Located near the center of Deck-4 is the ship's Galley.  Although capable of reproducing a variety of food selections, Mariner Class is equipped with both a food synthesizer system, and a fully functioning Galley.  Food stuffs for the Galley are stored in three separate fully compartmentalized pantries, each compartment equipped with their own stasis field generators to preserve freshness.</p>
          <p>The food synthesizer system is comprised of a matter re-sequencer system connected to the waste reclamation system.  The matter re-sequencer recycles biological waste materials into simple protein and sucrose compounds resembling meat/ dairy/ vegetable byproducts such as ground beef, fish or poultry, cheeses, fruit juices and preserves.  Although highly efficient, the re-sequencer is incapable of creating food stuffs with a complex layered formation as found in a turkey leg (with fat, bone and skin attached to the meat), or the fibrous consistency of fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>
          <p>Galley prepared or processed synthesized food stuffs are distributed via a computer controlled network of food dispensers.  Any materials left over from the meal such as the dinner ware, or undigested food stuffs placed back into the dispenser are automatically recycled into the waste reclamation system. Each dispenser consists of a closed circuit micro transporter mounted as an enclosed wall unit in specified areas through out the ship.  These areas include: the Brig, both the Forecastle and Fantail crew lounges, the Captain's, XO's, and VIP's quarters, Main Engineering, Sickbay, the Shuttlebay, and the Transporter Rooms.</p>

          <p>The ship's Sickbay is located on Deck-5, in the very center of the saucer section, and is the most highly protected section in the entire ship. Sickbay is comprised of two examination rooms separated by a surgical room, which in turn is also bordered by a recovery room. Each examination room is outfitted with two biobeds. The surgical room is similarly outfitted with two bio beds, which are in turn modified specifically for delicate surgical procedures. The recovery room is outfitted with twelve bio beds that are designed more for a patient's comfort and recovery. In addition, there is an emergency aid station located on every deck near the turbolift entrance.  Each aid station is nothing more then an equipment locker housing three antigrav gurneys, and two fully stocked emergency first aid kits.</p>

        <p>As stated before, the shuttlecraft landing bay is located aft of the secondary hull. The launch bay is comprised of a double set of doors as a safe guard against mechanical failure or damage suffered from combat. The Mariner's Shuttlebay is large enough to handle the maintenance and offloading requirements for a standard complement of five shuttle craft. The bay is capable of launching two shuttle craft at a time. During normal operations, as the double bay doors are opened, a level-4 force field is erected to keep the shuttlebay's atmosphere inside the ship while allowing for the safe launch or retrieval of shuttlecraft.</p>
