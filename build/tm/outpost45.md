History and Mission Overview {.title}
----------------------------

"Hello Boys! I'm Back!"

—Danny Russell (Independence Day)

Due to the threat of the Flarn, the Federation decided they needed extra
protection along the Flarn border, specifically at a planet named
Pilton. The Federation Department of Security decided they needed an
outpost with sufficient logistics capabilities to support a small fleet
of ships, and enough weapons to protect itself and Federation interests
in case of an attack. The resulting compromise was the Strategic
Outpost, the first and only planned being Outpost 45.

The station was placed at Pilton for several reasons. First, as an
established colony Pilton needed a spaceport to provide a stopping place
for commerce and shipping traffic. Second, Starfleet needed a platform
for defending the colony and a staging area for a defensive fleet. The
station and a small fleet of capital and boarder patrol ships has
provided protection for the colony on many occasions and now defends one
of the most critical areas along the Federation/Flarn border, Pilton.

Now with the creation of the Federation/Flarn Neutral Zone, Outpost 45
is once again tasked with monitoring the border, to help with the
enforcement of the agreement reached between the Flarn and the
Federation.

Structure and Construction {.title}
--------------------------

"These boats are light-built, and they are crafty and unlike the boats
of other folk."

—Elves (Lord of the Rings)

### Outpost Description {.title}

The outpost is set up in a manner similar to that of the Cardassian
built Terok Nor, now known as Deep Space 9. There are 2 docking rings
which hang off of the main column and are attached by support pylons to
the main column, which is a cylinder that tapers off at each end. At the
top there is the Command Level and the Watchtower, and at the bottom,
the communication/sensor equipment. The Main command section of the
outpost, the Command Level, is located on deck 2 of the main column of
the outpost.

Below the Command Level is the middle section of the main column which
contains the outposts work areas, living areas, storage space, and
commercial sector. This section also provides access to both the inner
and the outer docking ring. These rings are connected to the main column
through a series of pylons, which branch off of the main column.

Surrounding the top half of the main column is the inner and outer
docking rings. The inner and out docking rings are connected to the
center core by 6 support pylons placed every 60 degrees on the outpost.
At each intersection of the rings and pylons, there is a weapons turret
located on the top of the intersection.

The inner docking ring is divided into 6 parts by the pylons coming off
of the main column of the station. The inner ring is located between the
main column and the outer ring. The 6 sections between each of the
Pylons on the inner docking ring are known as the Hangers. The Outposts
shuttles, runabouts, and fighters are stored here along with their
respective support systems.

The outer docking ring is also divided into 6 different sections by the
pylons holding it to the main column of the outpost. Each section has
three airlocks spaced evenly along its length. These air locks face
outward towards space for head in docking. This allows up to 18 ships to
dock with the station at one time.

The lower half of the main column contains the station's power core,
main computer core, auxiliary computer core, more storage space, and
environmental controls. Below the main column extends the stations
communication and long range sensor equipment for another 500 meters.

### Construction {.title}

The Construction of the station is a standard Duranium/Tritanium double
hull transporter welded into place. The hulls around both the Main Ops
Deck, and the Auxiliary Ops Deck, along with the power core, and docking
pylons and rings have been made denser to make them stronger. The hull
was also strengthened around the promenade area of the Outpost as that
area as also designed to be a lifeboat in the case of environmental
failure onboard the Outpost. This is accompanied by an extremely strong
structural integrity field. Most of pre-construction took place in
various parts of the federation and final assembly took place on site
over Pilton. All in all, the entire project took approximately 3 years
from start to finish.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems {.title}
----------------------------------

WSKRS, we used to call them roving periscopes.

—Captain Nathan Hale Bridger (seaQuest)

### Sensors {.title}

The outpost is equipped with Type-XIII sensor array. The systems high
resolution scanning range is 7 light-years, with a range of 23
light-years at low resolution. Most of the sensors are placed at the
bottom of the main column with the communication system. There are
groups of secondary sensors placed in strategic locations over the rest
of the main column, and the outer & inner docking rings giving the
station full sensor coverage.

The Watchtower is also used to help supplement the Outposts sensor
array, by linking to all Starfleet ships in the sector, the border
protection outposts, as well as sensor relays placed along the border,
and using their sensor arrays to get a larger scan of the area.

### Science Probes {.title}

The Outpost contains 9 different types of probes, ranging from Class I
to Class IX. These probes are kept available for ships needing to
resupply, and in limited quantities for the Outposts own use.

There are approximately 750 casings available for use by the different
types of probes. These casings are stored along with the torpedoes in
the torpedo magazines for quick supply of docked starships, and supply
to the Outposts launchers.

If for some reason more probes are needed then are currently in supply
of the Outpost, the replicators in the Machine Shop are programmed to
create the necessary internal components for all of the types of probes
that the Outpost keeps in supply.

### Computer Core {.title}

The outposts main computer core is set up to run with bio-neural
circuitry. Many of the cores processors are also comprised of bio-neural
circuitry, though the main storage capability still relies with
isolinear chips. This computer core is referred to as the Mark XX+.
There is an auxiliary core to supplement the main computer core in case
of its failure. The auxiliary core is also a Mark XX+. The cores utilize
an active redundancy from the main core to the auxiliary core in case
there is a failure in the main core. Through a hard wired connection
between the two cores, the main computer core creates a daily backup to
the secondary computer core. In case of a catastrophic failure of the
main computer core, the hard line connection may be severed to isolate
the secondary computer core. There is also a designated computer core
for the Watchtower, housed on decks 1 and 2. This core is connected to
the other cores, and in the time of an emergency, can be used to take
over basic control of the stations systems.

Due to the security, and the computing power the Watchtower requires, a
separate computer core has been placed next to the Watchtower. This core
is designated for analysis of data, or any other information that the
Watchtower reviews. In the state of a dire emergency, where the Main
Computer Core and the Auxiliary Computer Core are damaged, the
Watchtowers core can handle bare minimum functions necessary to keep the
Outpost running until either the Auxiliary Core, or the Main Core
returns to working order, indefinitely.

Maneuvering Thrusters {.title}
---------------------

The Admiral was wondering if I might take a look at the main drive
propulsion units

—Captain Nathan Hale Bridger (seaQuest)

Along the outer edge of the outer docking ring, and on the dorsal and
ventral sides of the docking ring, are a set of 64 RCS based maneuvering
thrusters. These thrusters allow the station to remain in a stable
synchronous orbit around Pilton. This system also allows the station to
hold its position during firing of weapons and launch of ships from the
station. They are tied into the computer system to allow automatic
operation. But if need be the systems can be operated manually from the
both the Main Operations Deck, and the Auxiliary Operations Deck.

Tactical Systems {.title}
----------------

Guns, lots of guns.

—Neo (The Matrix)

### Defensive Shields {.title}

The outpost has a redundant high capacity shield system. The graviton
emitters are extended along major sections of the main column. These are
further enhanced with graviton emitters on the inner docking ring
sections. The outposts shield grid will still operate even if one of the
emitter sections is off line. The way it is set up is if one section of
the shields is penetrated, gravitons from another section are shunted to
the breached area, effectively closing the breach. Depending on the size
of the breech, the strength of the shields overall will fluctuate.

The heart of the shield system lies in a series of 18 graviton
generators tied to function in tandem with each other.

 Shield Maximum Graviton Load 
:   8064 Megawatts (continuous)

 Shield Maximum Energy Dissipation Rate 
:   2.19 x 10\^6 kilowatts

### Offensive Systems Overview {.title}

Due to the staggered layout of the weapons systems, any approaching
hostile vessel can expect approximately six weapon systems to be
tracking it depending on its range from the station. If a ship passes
out of the targeting area of one system, the system automatically
transfers the lock to a different part of the system.

The weapon systems are further staggered by range. Ships can first
expect to be hit by torpedoes and type X phaser fire. This would be
followed by attack from rotating phaser emplacements, and finally mini
torpedo launchers. Of course should something survive all of this and
happens to board the Outpost, there is always the Self-Destruct System.

#### Main Column, Dorsal Section, Offensive Systems {.title}

Placed on each support pylon at the base of the dorsal section, and
stopping near the turrets for the inner rings is a Type X collinear
phaser emplacements. These six units are mainly meant to protect the top
of the station, but do have the capability to aim in a lateral
direction. They are made up of 200 Type X phaser emitters each.

 Type X Phasers 
:    Max Energy Output 
    :   5.1 Megawatts

     Effective Range 
    :   300,000 km

#### Inner Docking Ring, Dorsal Section, Offensive Systems {.title}

At the top cross section of each support pylon and the inner rings is a
rotating turret. Each of these six units consists of a single dual pulse
cannon on the rotating section and a rapid fire mini torpedo launcher
above. Each mini torpedo launcher is fed directly from one of 6 torpedo
storage areas within the main column of the outpost. Each launcher is
fed by 3 conveyer tubes each, allowing on demand selection of sensor,
photon, or quantum mini torpedoes. While these units are mainly meant
for Lateral defense, all of the units can also provide dorsal
protection.

 Type IX Phasers 
:    Max Energy Output 
    :   3.4 Megawatts

     Effective Range 
    :   200,000 km

 Mini Torpedoes 
:    Effective Range 
    :   75,000 km

#### Outer Docking Ring, Dorsal and Ventral Sections, Offensive Systems {.title}

At the top and bottom section of each support pylons for the outer rings
is a rotating turret. Each of these six units consists of dual pulse
Type IX cannons on the rotating section, with a rapid fire torpedo
launcher in between the two rotating units. Each torpedo launcher is fed
directly from one of 6 torpedo storage areas within the main column of
the outpost. The torpedo launcher is fed by 3 conveyer tubes each,
allowing on demand selection of sensor, photon, or quantum torpedoes.
These units are used for Lateral defense.

 Type IX Phasers 
:    Max Energy Output 
    :   3.4 Megawatts

     Effective Range 
    :   200,000 km

 Torpedoes 
:    Effective Range 
    :   350,000 km

#### Main Column, Ventral Section, Offensive Systems {.title}

At the Edge of the Ventral Section of the main column parallel to the
support pylons are six more Rotating Turrets. Each of these 6 units
consists of dual pulse Type IX cannons on the rotating section and a
rapid fire mini torpedo launcher below. Each mini torpedo launcher is
fed directly from one of 6 torpedo storage areas within the main column
of the outpost. Each launcher is fed by 3 feed conveyer tubes allowing
on demand selection of sensor, photon, or quantum mini torpedoes. While
these units are mainly meant for Lateral defense, all of the units can
also provide ventral protection.

 Type IX Phasers 
:    Max Energy Output 
    :   3.4 Megawatts

     Effective Range 
    :   200,000 km

 Mini Torpedoes 
:    Effective Range 
    :   75,000 km

#### Power Core Section, Offensive Systems {.title}

Starting at the bottom of the outer docking ring to the bottom of the
outpost are six Type X collinear phaser emplacements. These units are
mainly meant for ventral protection, but do have the capability for
lateral protection. They are made up of 100 Type X phaser Emitters each.

 Type X Phasers 
:    Max Energy Output 
    :   5.1 Megawatts

     Effective Range 
    :   300,000 km

#### Main Torpedo Storage {.title}

There are six storage areas within the main column of the outpost used
to store the outpost torpedoes and mini torpedoes. Each section can
store about 1000 Torpedoes and 2000 Mini Torpedoes. While not all of
this meant for defense of the outpost, they can all be used toward
station defense because of the direct feed conveyer systems used to
bring torpedoes from storage to the launchers. Within 20 seconds of
Yellow alert, each torpedo launcher and mini torpedo launcher will see
the beginning of a close to never ending supply of torpedoes.

This same conveyor system is used to re-supply torpedoes to ships that
come to the outpost for re-supply. It simply extends passed the torpedo
room all the way into the inner and outer docking rings.

The Station torpedo breaks down for both Regular and mini variation
torpedoes are as follows.

-   25% Quantum

-   50% Photon

Of this, only half of these torpedoes are for outpost use, while the
rest is designated for ship re-supply use. Of course, this still this
leaves about 2250 torpedoes and 6000 mini torpedoes for outpost use.

### Self-Destruct System {.title}

In the extreme case where the Outposts outer defenses have failed, the
outposts crew can initiate the Self-Destruct System.

To initiate the system, the Commanding Officer, or the acting Commanding
Officer (aCO), must state their name and rank, their position on the
Outpost, their command code, and initiate Outpost Self-Destruct System.

Next, two members of the senior staff must also state their name and
rank, their position on the Outpost, their command code, and initiate
Outpost Self-Destruct System.

Finally, the CO, or the aCO, must state if he has any specific
instructions for the Self-Destruct System, and the amount of time until
the system initiates. Finally the CO, or aCO, states start countdown.

Once the System is initiated, it may only be stopped by the
authorization of 2 senior staff members.

The system works in 4 stages. All 4 stages happen almost simultaneously,
with only fractions of a second between each stage. In the 1st stage, an
EM pulse is sent through the 3 computer cores, erasing any sensitive
information that might survive the self-destruct sequence. In the 2nd
Stage, the EM pulse runs through all the conduits on the station,
blowing out all the circuitry. The 3rd stage consists of setting off
charges located throughout the entire Outpost. These charges not only
break up the Outpost into smaller pieces, but decompress the entire
Outpost. The 4th and final stage is when the torpedoes stored on the
Outpost are detonated. At one time it had been considered to detonate
the fusion reactors as well. But simulations showed that there would be
to much collateral damage done to Pilton if this were to happen. Thus it
was decided not to include the detonation of the fusion reactors in main
process of the self-destruct. Though a collateral explosion will occur
with the containment failure of the reactors, this explosion would not
be large enough to endanger the population of Pilton.

### Command Level Overview {.title}

The Command Level is the brain of the Outpost. It contains the Outposts
Operations Deck, the Watchtower, the Captains Ready Room, XO�s Ready
Room, Briefing Room, armory, and restrooms. The Command Level is located
on deck 2 of the Outpost. Command Level sections are marked with an
asterisk.

### Operations Deck {.title}

The numbers referred to in this section, relate to the numbers located
on the graphic of deck 2 of the Outpost.

The Operations Deck is located on Deck 2 of the Outpost. This is to
provide extra protection in the case of an emergency. The Ops Deck is
divided into two levels, with the second level being half a meter above
the first level. The first level is at the same level as the rest of the
deck.

At the front of the Operations Deck, and the first level, in the exact
middle, is a door leading to the Briefing Room. On each side of the door
is a view screen. The view screen on the left of the door (1) is used to
show the movements of ships along the Flarn border. The view screen on
the right side of the door (2) is used to show communications, and works
just like a view screen on a ship. The consoles on the left side of the
first level (3, 4), are used by the Strategic Operations Officer, and
his staff to access data on the operations deck. There are also two
consoles on the right side of the Operations Deck. The console closer to
the front of the Operations Deck (5) is used by the science staff to
analyze data on the operations deck. The other console on the right side
of the operations deck (6), is used by the Docking Control Officer. The
chair in the center of the Ops Deck (7), is for the Command Duty
Officer, or the Captain when he is on the Operations Deck. The table in
front of the command chair (8), is used for any staff wanting to access
data. It is also used for briefings done on the Operations Deck.

There are 5 consoles on the second level of the Operations Deck. The
console at the front, and left (9) is the Operations console. The
Operations Officer can access the Outposts systems, including
communications, sensors, transporters, tractor beams, and the outposts
manoeuvring thrusters. The console next to it (10), is the Outposts
tactical console. From this console, the officer can access of the
Outposts weapons. The console in the middle of the second level (11), is
used to access the schematics of the Outpost. It can also be used to
monitor the Outposts systems, and movement of personal on the outpost.
The console on the back and left side of the second level (12), is used
to access, and monitor the stations computer core. If by chance the
stations auxiliary core does not activated when needed, this station can
be used to activate it. The console next to it (13), is used to monitor
the stations Power Core, and fusion generators. This station, if needed,
can be used to reactivate the power core if it does not do so
automatically.

There are six other exits, besides the door leading to the briefing
room, off of the Main Operations Deck. The doors at the back of both the
first and second levels, lead to the hallway behind the Operations Deck.
The door located on the left side of Ops leads to the Captains Ready
Room. There are two doors on the right side of the Ops Deck. The door
closest to the front of Ops leads to a turbolift. That turbolift has
only other one stop, the Auxiliary Operations Deck. The second door
leads to the escape pods located on Deck 2 of the Outpost.

### Watchtower {.title}

Due to the closeness to the Federation/Flarn border, the outpost was
commissioned with an added feature. This feature is called the Strategic
Lab. The Lab is located on deck 2, on the opposite side of the
Watchtower from the Operations Deck. The Lab is used for analyzing
sensor data on enemy fleet movements along the border. It is also used
for decrypting communications.

Only Command Level Officers and Strategic Officers have access to the
Strategic Lab. As such it is guarded at all times by at least 2 high
level Security officers.

For Information on the Watchtower Computer Core, please see the section
relating to the Outposts computers above.

### Station Commander's Office {.title}

The Station Commanders Office is off of the left side of the Operations
Deck. As you enter the room, on the left is the CO's desk. On the right
side of the CO's desk is a large console where the CO can access
communications, and the Outposts library. There is also a desktop unit
situated on the desk that can access the Outposts library, and reports
on the Outposts status. Behind the CO's desk is a holographic
communications unit. Next to it, built into the wall, is a replicator.
Opposite of the door leading into the ready room, is a couch. When you
look to the right, when you enter the Ready Room, there is another door.
This door leads to the CO's private bathroom.

### XO's Office {.title}

The XO's Office is located next to the CO's Office. It can be accessed
by the hallway behind the Main Ops Deck. As you enter, on the left is
the XO's desk, similar to the CO's desk, and on the right is a couch. On
the opposite side of the desk, is the door leading to the XO's private
washroom.

### Briefing Room {.title}

The Briefing Room is located directly off of the Operations deck. In the
center of the Briefing Room, is a large conference table, surrounded by
12 chairs. Though if needed more chairs can be added. On the wall
looking out into space, are six floor to ceiling windows.

On the side of the Briefing Room is an attached room, called the Senior
Officers Lounge. This is a place where the Senior Staff can come to
unwind after a long day, but still stay close to the Main Ops Deck.

### Weapons Locker {.title}

The deck 2 weapons locker is located outside of Main Ops on the right
side. The usual weapons complement includes Type II Phasers, and Type
III Phaser Riffles. Access codes to the weapons locker are limited to
the senior staff.

### Auxiliary Operations Deck {.title}

In the case that the stations main Operations Deck is either destroyed,
or compromised. The stations systems can be controlled from an Aux. Ops,
which is located on Deck 22.

Auxiliary Ops is one flat level, instead of the two that the Main
Operations Deck, in the Watchtower, has.

At the very front of Aux. Ops, there is a view screen, right in the
middle of the wall. This screen can display anything from images of
outside the Outpost, to communications, to fleet movements.

In the front third of the Aux Ops Deck, there are two large consoles.
When looking at them, with your back to the view screen, the console on
the left is the tactical console, same as the tactical console on the
Main Ops Deck. The console on the right is the ops console. The stations
orbital thrusters can be activated from here, as well as the
communication systems, sensor arrays, and transporters. In the middle
there is a large table, where blueprints of the Outpost can be brought
up and displayed. Also from this station, fleet movements can be
monitored. In the back, there are two large consoles. These consoles are
the engineering consoles. The one on the left, when looking at them, has
a direct link to the stations Power Core Monitoring Center. The console
on the right is linked to the stations computer cores.

Behind the two back consoles are two three doors. The door on the far
right, when looking at them, is a direct turbolift to the Main Ops Deck.
The door on the far left, is a standard turbolift that connects the
entire station. The door in the middle opens up into the halls outside
of Aux Ops.

### Infirmary {.title}

Infirmary is on deck 11, right off of the Promenade, and can be broken
down into 6 areas.

#### 1st Area: Main Treating Area {.title}

As you enter infirmary, it's the first area you enter. This area has 4
biobeds, 2 against each wall. There is a large station in the middle for
general use. This is the area were all patients go to first.

On the back wall, there are 5 doors. The door on the far left, when
looking into infirmary, leads to the CMO's office. The next door on the
left leads to the Critical Care Unit. The door in the exact middle is a
large double door, which leads to the Recovery Ward. The next door to
the right of the middle leads to the surgical suites. The door on the
far right leads to the Medical Lab.

#### 2nd Area: Critical Care Unit {.title}

The Critical Care Unit is similar to a 21st Century Intensive Care Unit.
There are 6 biobeds along the back wall. Each bed is separated from the
next by a floor to ceiling wall. There is a nurses station situated
right next to the door coming in from the Main Treating Area. On the far
left, there is a second door, which leads to the Recovery Ward.

#### 3rd Area: Surgical Suites {.title}

There are two surgical suites at the disposal of the medical staff. They
are both completely sterile, and can only be accessed by an air-lock
type door, connected to the prep room. Both suites are situated side by
side.

The prep room is between the surgical suites and the Main Treating Area.
Here the surgeons use a sonic cleaning device to scrub up before a
procedure. There are 4 doors in this room. The two doors on the back
wall lead to the surgical suites. The one on the wall opposite from the
doors leading to the surgical suites leads back to the Main Treating
Area. The door on the left wall leads to the Recovery Ward.

#### 4th Area: CMOs Office {.title}

The CMO's Office is located directly off of the Main Treating Area. It
is like every other Department Head office. The only difference, the far
wall, when looking into the office from the Main Treating Area, is a
huge wall display. This display shows patient information, and the
status of the patients in infirmary at the time.

There is another door leading to the Critical Care Unit on the right
wall of the office.

#### 5th Area: Medical Lab {.title}

The Medical Lab is the most sophisticated part of infirmary. In this
area personnel can run almost any test, or experiment, they would want
to run, from a genetic re-sequencing project, to looking for a simple
virus.

#### 6th Area: Recovery Ward {.title}

The Recovery Ward contains 30 biobeds, 15 on each wall. The ward is used
to hold, and monitor patients that they cannot release right away.

At the back of the ward are four doors. These doors lead to four private
recovery rooms. These rooms are available for someone who needs to stay
in infirmary for a long period of time, or VIP's.

### Holographic Crewmembers {.title}

The outpost also carries a holographic crewmember. There is a copy of
the EMH Mark IV in the Outposts computer core. The EMH have complete
access to critical parts of the Outpost that immediate medical attention
might be required:

-   Infirmary
-   Operations
-   Auxiliary Operations
-   Holodecks
-   VIP Quarters (can only be transferred here by Command Level Officers
    only)

Emergency Medical Kits are provided at each of these locations for the
use of medical staff, and the EMH.

### Science Labs {.title}

The Outpost's science labs located on Deck 14 of the station. They are
located on the outer edge of the Outpost, so if needed, they may be
upgraded quite easily. They are also located there as after the war had
ended with the Flarn, they were added to the Outpost to help increase
its science capabilities. The Labs available for the science departments
use are a Cultural Anthropology Lab, Cybernetics Lab, Exobiology Lab,
Planetary Science Lab, Stellar Cartography, and a Genetics Lab, beyond
the standard Biology, Chemistry, and Physics lab.

### Brig {.title}

The Brig is located on Deck 12, right off of the Promenade, and unlike
most stations, the COS office isn't connected to the Brig. There is
always at least one security officer manning the brig at all times,
regardless of whether someone is being held there or not.

There are 10 cells located in the brig. There is also 1 maximum security
cell that can be used in the case of dangerous criminal is to be held on
the station. The maximum-security cell is a box made out of 10
centimeters of solid duranium. On both sides of all the walls
forcefields are in place. Inside the cell there is one bed which is
bolted to the floor. Along the back wall, there is a 5 millimeter gap
along the floor. This is where the ventilation system connects to the
cell. At the entrance, there is an airlock. The airlock is created by
two 5 centimeter thick duranium doors. So when a delivery of some sort
is made, the prisoner cannot escape. There are also a series of
forcefields in place inside of the airlock, which are disabled by the
guard on duty when someone needs to gain access. In the case of a power
failure, the doors to the airlock are automatically locked into place by
a series of bolts, which fit into resting places inside of the walls.
This cell however is rarely used, and is usually deactivated.

The entire brig is surrounded by a dampening field, there are also two
automated defense turrets, one located on each side of the door, in case
the prisoners manage to escape and overpower the guards on duty at the
time.

### Main Weapons Locker {.title}

The station's Main Weapons Locker is located on deck 13. Their are also
smaller weapons lockers located throughout the outpost. The Weapons
Lockers are the location of the outposts personal weapons. Here
personnel can find phasers, and phaser rifles. All are set upon their
chargers when not in use. In the Main Weapons Locker, there are 4 rows
of hand phasers when you first walk in. Along all the walls, the rifles
are situated. There are also 2 more rows for the rifles behind the hand
phasers. Along the back wall are three TR-116 Projectile Rifles secured
in secondary compartments that need authorization by the COS, CO, or XO
to release them.

There is also Heavy Weapons locker located in the very back of the Main
Weapons Locker. Located within the Heavy Weapons Locker are Mark I
Photon Mortars, Isomagnetic Disintegrators, Tetryon Pulse Launchers, and
Photon Grenades. Only the COS, CO and XO have authorization to grant
access to the Heavy Weapons locker.

### Security Vault {.title}

The Security Vault, or just Vault for short, is where anybody can come
to store valuables that they do not feel comfortable leaving in there
quarters. The Vault is dived into 2 sections, the reception area, and
the vault. The reception area is manned by 3 security personal. When
someone comes in and wishes to store something in the vault, they are
issued a key card.

To access the vault, two of the security personal on duty must
simultaneously swipe their own key cards through scanners located on
either side of the vaults entrance.

The are 5 rows of lockers where people can store there valuables. To
access the locker, both the depositors key card, and one of the security
personnel's must be passed through the scanner.

The vault is heavily protected. The walls of the vault are 15
centimeters of Duranium. And there is a forcefield on either side of the
wall. The forcefields are tied into a back-up generator located inside
of the vault, so if power fails, the forcefields would not immediately
go down. There is also an automated defense system located inside of the
vault, so if someone enters, without the proper access, they are stunned
by gas that is released into the vault. Also as a measure of protection,
there is a dampening field in effect within the vault.

The security vault is also located on deck 12, next to the brig, and off
of the promenade.

### Outpost Override System {.title}

In the event that the Outpost is taken over by hostile forces, and the
crew has been forced off of the Ops Deck, they may temporarily regain
control of the Outpost. If either the CO, or the XO, and 2 other DH's
make it to the Auxiliary Ops Deck, they can initiate the Outpost
Override System.

To initiate the override system, all three must state their name and
rank, their position on the Outpost, and their command code.

When the three state their codes, the Outpost computer allows them to
access the Outpost systems from the Auxiliary Ops Deck. After this is
done, the system automatically locks out control of the Outpost from the
Main Ops Deck. This system is hardwired into Outposts computer cores,
and the secondary processors located throughout the Outpost.

Utility Systems {.title}
---------------

It's no game, cutting edge technology.

—Lucas

### Power Systems {.title}

The outpost has an extremely powerful power system. The main power
source for the Outpost is a set of 6 fusion generators. The fusion
generators are placed in a stacked formation, with each one on top of
the other, and placed together in a circular casing. These generators
are in turn called the power core. The power core is located on Decks 47
to 58. There is also 3 other fusion generators located on Decks 27 to
33. These help to supplement the outposts power core. Emergency power
generators are located on Decks 19 to 21.

### Cargo bays {.title}

The Outpost has over 30 dedicated cargo bays with most of the cargo
being stored on deck 40 to 45. All of the cargo bays are also fitted
with cargo transporters. They have a range of 40,000 kilometers. Several
of the cargo bays, which are on the outside edge of the Outpost, have
airlocks so larger items, which the transporter can not handle, can be
moved in manually.

### Tractor Emitters {.title}

The Outpost is also fitted with tractor emitters on the lower edges of
the outer ring. They are also located on the dorsal side of the inner
ring. At a range of 2500 meters, the emitters can hold a 2,300,000
metric ton object. At a distance of 15,000 kilometers, the emitters can
hold a metric ton. The Outposts RCS, along with the orbit of the Outpost
help to keep it in place during these operations.

### Transporters {.title}

There are 25 six padded transporters, which are located on decks
throughout the station. They have a range of 40,000 kilometers. There
are also 25 emergency transporters that can be that can be used in case
of an emergency. They each have a range of 15,000 kilometers.

### Power Core Monitoring Center {.title}

The most important spot on the Outpost, next to the Ops Desk, is the
Power Core Monitoring Center (PCMC). Here the stations Power Core, and
four fusion generators are watched, and regulated here. Though the Power
Core is mostly automated, there are times when a station personal must
manually correct a problem. In the case of Power Core, or Fusion
Generator shut down, they could only be restarted either from Main
Operations, Auxiliary Operations, or the PCMC. It is located on Deck 46
over the main power core. There is usually at least one Ops officer
stationed here at all times in case of a failure.

### Machine Shop {.title}

There is also a [machine shop](machineshop.html "Machine Shop") located
on the Outpost. Here any components that cannot be replicated are
created, or repaired. There is also an industrial replicator located in
the machine shop to replicate components for the outpost. It is located
on Deck 40 close to the cargo conveyer system that runs through out the
station.

### Holodecks {.title}

The outpost, even though it is mainly for defense, does contain
recreational facilities. It holds 6 holodecks on deck 12. The holodecks
are open to anyone as long as the Outpost is at Status Green.

### Blue Step Lounge {.title}

The Observation Lounge, also called the Blue Step Lounge, is located on
deck 1 of the Outpost. The only entrance to the lounge is the 2
turbolifts. The center of the lounge is where a doughnut shaped bar is
located. In the center of the bar are 3 replicators. When the
Observation Lounge is used to host guests, the bartender manning the bar
will serve drinks, and food from the replicator located behind the bar.
Along all the walls, except for where the stage is located, there are
windows open to space, allowing for guests to take in the magnificent
view.

In between the two tubolifts is the Lounges main stage. The Blue Step
Lounge also contains holoemiters to provide a wider arrange of
entertainment. They are set over the main stage.

Behind the stage is the continuation of the watchtower computer core.

The Blue Step Lounge is restricted to Starfleet Personnel only, and is
the normal venue for diplomatic events. On special occasions the
Outposts Galley has been known to prepare meals for events held in the
Lounge.

### Mess Hall / Galley {.title}

For those that do not wish to pay for non replicated foods or cannot
afford to, or for someone who just wants to have a place to socialize,
there is the Mess Hall on deck 10. The Mess Hall serves a free daily
special consisting of whatever materials can be found in the quantities
needed to feed most of the station. Normally this meal is made up of
food reaching its expiration date, cargo shipments that where never
picked up, or other such cases.

Because of this chaotic nature of how real food supplies are 'found',
the mess hall operates on three rules. "First come, first served,"
"Supplies are limited, and "Seconds are unlikely." These rules, and the
limited capabilities to feed most of the station with real food has made
Mess Hall lunch a hit or miss objective for most of the station since
most of the food 'Magically' seems to loose some amount of flavor the
moment its programmed into the replicators.

The Galley has also been known to prepare special meals at the request
of the Commanding Officer.

There are also replicators located in the Mess Hall, except they are not
programmed to dispense alcohol.

### Replicators {.title}

There are also small replicators in each of the quarters that can
replicate any food supplement to synthehol.

### Commercial Area {.title}

Decks 10 and 11 are the stations commercial area. Here different
retailers have come and set up shop on the Outpost. All retailers are
welcome on the Outpost. The area is set up in a ring shape. In the
middle of the two decks are the shops. There are shops on both levels.
On the lower level of the commercial area are the entrances to
infirmary, the brig, and the vault. On the outer edge of the lower ring
is the location of the transport cars to the docking rings.

### Quarters {.title}

The VIP Quarters and the first level of the Standard Personal Quarters
have modifiable environmental controls to accommodate Class H, K, L, N,
and N(2) atmospheres. These quarters are located on Deck 6.

### Strategic Operations Officer {.title}

A Strategic Operations Officer is required to be assigned to the outpost
at all times. The Strategic Operations Officer coordinates all of the
Intelligence from Starfleet ships, and helps coordinate with the ships
in planning tactical maneuvers. He also acts as the Outposts
Intelligence Officer, and may double as the Outposts Tactical Officer.

Auxiliary Spacecraft Systems {.title}
----------------------------

Jenny, start closing the main airlock now

—Bobby (seaQuest)

The outpost has 6 hangars in the inner ring that surrounds the main core
of the outpost. Each hangar has the capacity to hold 2 runabouts, or 6
shuttlecraft. They also have the capacity to hold the weapons load out
needed by the shuttlecrafts and runabouts. The standard complement at
this time is 5 runabouts and 9 shuttlecrafts.

The station also carries 24 worker bees. There are 4 worker bees per
hanger.

The hangers are mostly open floor space for the most part. Lining all of
the walls, except the wall located opposite the door leading into the
hanger, are racks, where extra torpedoes are stored for use on the
shuttles and runabouts if the feed from the magazines is interrupted. On
the wall with no torpedo racks are where the 4 worker bees are stored.
They are stored in recesses inside of the wall. When they are needed,
they are brought out, and are launched. The ceiling of the hanger is one
large door. When the craft are launched the doors part, opening the
hanger to space. There is a forcefield in place, so that pressure can be
maintained when the doors are opened.

Below the main hanger bays are Maintenance bays. Using hydraulic lifts
support ships can be brought down to the Maintenance bay for repairs.

In the place of the shuttlecrafts, and runabouts, a total of 18 Ranger
class bombers, 24 Compsognathus class interceptors, or 24 Cutlass class
fighters, can be placed into the hangers.

The fighters are launched using the same procedure as the shuttles are,
flying through the open hanger bay doors. At one time it was considered
placing in an emergency launch system that involved the fighters
dropping through the floor of the hanger bay. But it was decided against
this, and a maintenance bay was placed under each hanger for repair work
on any shuttle, fighter, or runabout currently in the hanger.
