History and Mission Overview {.title}
----------------------------

In the early days of 2383, there were those in Starfleet, mostly in the
Exploratory Division, who foresaw what was now becoming a new 'Golden
Age of Exploration' for the Federation and its allies. Because of this
there was an obvious need for a new multi-purpose deep space explorer,
one that would recall the earliest values of the Federation.

The designers decided upon a large ship platform that would house some
of the finest sensors, warp engines, and shield systems that were
offered during and after the Dominion War. At the same time these
designers gave the ship ample weapons to defend itself in its missions
of exploration and diplomacy. Finally, the designers built into the
class many redundant and resilient systems, as well as expanded work
areas to increase its endurance when far from Federation space. The
designers hoped in later years that this design would replace the older
Excelsior and Ambassador Class vessels in the fleet. They also intended
it to be an alternate design to the proven Galaxy and Viking class
explorers.

However, as design work continued into the ending months of 2386, an
alliance was forged between the Federation and the newly discovered
Flea'’tan Alliance. A technology exchange occurred between the two
powers, and several ship design workers of the Alliance came to assist
in the design of this and several other new classes. Once brought up to
speed on how ship design work of Federation technology functioned, they
began inputting their own technologies and ideas into the new vessel's
framework. To this co-operative design came a new deep space explorer of
a kind unseen since Starfleet’'s earliest days of co-operative
expansion.

As a year passed with final design work, June of 2387 finally heralded
the first prototype to come out of the Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards. The
USS Mythology NX-98711 was given over to Starfleet Command for full
review and approval. Finding such a well stocked vessel able to fit many
core mission profiles Starfleet Command in the final months of 2387 gave
the approval for the official construction of the Mythology class deep
space explorer.

### Mission Profiles {.title}

Due to its large size and self reliance, the Mythology class is well
suited to the following mission profiles:

-   Long term deep space exploration and patrols
-   First contact with new races and entities

With inclusion of its mission modules the Mythology has further expanded
profiles:

-   Large scale diplomatic functions
-   Large scale cargo transport
-   Large scale entertainment functions
-   Large scale search and rescue operations
-   Colonization of planets
-   Fleet level command and control
-   Emergency evacuations

Structure and Construction {.title}
--------------------------

The Mythology class is a large ship platform spanning 45 decks. Its
saucer begins in an inset teardrop and angles out and back into a half
oval near the rear. A thick, wide neck connects it seamlessly in an
angled slope to the engineering hull. This hull section is like the top
of a tear drop at the front, only to angle back near the aft section to
a square broad base. The warp nacelles are mounted to the aft section of
the engineering hull.

The warp nacelles are positioned on short variable struts that enable
the nacelles to project from the engineering hull in an upward 90 degree
arc. The designers kept them as close as possible to the main space
frame to reduce its profile were combat to occur, while at the same time
allowing enough room for the nearby mission module docking areas to be
easily swapped as needed.

To further specify, decks 1 through 20 are in the saucer; 21 through 45
form the engineering hull.

The hull structure of the Mythology is composed of a 75 / 25 mixture
duranium / tritanium alloy double layered hull inset with hardened
duranium fillings. The design was then transporter welded along the
whole superstructure. Finally, the hull was covered with high density
duranium alloy, with composite duranium plastic sheets, measuring 5.0 cm
thick as a secondary layer of protection.

### Mission Modules {.title}

The Mythology class has three mission module swap areas. The first is
located aft of the bridge and below on an angle from shuttle bay 1 on
decks 5 through 8; the other two are located in the engineering hull.
They are placed on the lower aft port and starboard areas of the
connecting structure on decks 30 through 33. These modules are easily
hot swapped out at any star base that has such facilities. Typical swap
over times range from 3 to 5 days. When a particular module suite is
chosen by the Captain and Command officers for the mission ahead all
three bays are used.

The available modules are as follows:

 Expanded Cargo Module 
:   In their default configuration these modules are open bay areas
    often used for on hand spare parts or supplies for the mission
    ahead. This allows the Mythology further cargo storage for long
    range missions or large scale supply efforts.

 Planetary Colonization Module 
:   This suite of modules gives the Mythology class the ability to
    operate as a colonization ship. When installed it gives:

    -   Quarters for up to 500 colonists
    -   Six months of consumables
    -   Various colony supplies for construction and setup
    -   Essential and specialized terra-forming equipment storage

 Expanded Diplomatic Module 
:   This suite of modules gives expanded diplomatic meeting rooms. When
    installed it gives:

    -   Twelve Ambassadorial quarters each
    -   Two hundred staff quarters each
    -   One conference hall complex with bar and mess area for 200
        guests
    -   12 twelve seat briefing rooms
    -   Facilities and quarters, for up to 100 members of the press
    -   All areas are capable of supporting H, K, or L environments

 Expanded Entertainment Module 
:   When installed it gives the Mythology expanded entertainment
    capabilities, including:

    -   Sixteen holosuites
    -   Six recreation and performance halls for live performances
    -   Three 100 yard long twelve feet deep swimming pools with spa
        facilities
    -   Three casinos with two deck bars
    -   Three cargo and replication areas for entertainment storage and
        small scale fabrication
    -   Fifteen fusion generators to support the added power demands of
        each module, five generators are located in each module.

 Expanded Weapons and Fleet Operations Control Module 
:   This suite of modules when installed gives the Mythology expanded
    weapon set-ups, as well as the ability to more easily coordinate
    fleet operations. It also includes the capacity for tactical
    missions where heavy scale boarding actions are required.

    -   Six Type VIII phaser arrays, two to each module, with 25
        emitters each, each array outputting 2.6 megawatts to a range of
        150,000 km
    -   25 Marine personnel barracks in module one in the saucer
    -   A fleet operations and control suite in module one in the saucer
        to coordinate fleet movements and activities
    -   Two auxiliary craft bays in module two and three each with two
        Danube class runabouts with included heavy weapons pod, and
        Marine personnel carrier module
    -   The modules each come equipped with the needed power, supply and
        equipment and storage areas

 Search and Rescue Operations Module 
:   This suite of modules gives the Mythology the ability to evacuate
    and treat critically injured refugees from stricken sites, as well
    as providing enhanced material for large scale search and rescue
    missions and medical relief efforts.

    -   50 JO sized quarters in module 1 in the saucer, each room
        capable of holding 4 people comfortably
    -   One cargo bay in module 1, containing relief and medical
        supplies for the treatment of refugees aboard ship
    -   Two 50 biobed triage sickbays in modules 2 and 3
    -   20 medical crew quarters, ten to each module in modules two and
        three in the engineering hull

 Flea'tan Compression Relay Jump Core Module 
:   Located on decks 40 and 41, just behind the primary warp core, is
    located a modular area for the sole use of the experimental
    Flea'’tan Compression Relay Jump Core. This modular area is set up
    for the use of this core for those Mythology ships in the Fleet 5
    and 6 areas of operation where the relay network is in use. For
    those Mythology ships not in such operational areas this modular bay
    is left empty and open for use as the crew sees fit to accommodate
    mission needs in flight.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems {.title}
----------------------------------

### Sensor Systems {.title}

The Mythology houses the Class 10 sensor system. This system design
layout gained high praise by scientists and tactical minded designers
alike during the later stages of the Dominion War for its reliability
and ease of use over older systems and design set-ups. The system has a
maximum high resolution range out to 5.0 light years, and a low
resolution range out to 17.0 light years. The system has built in
redundancies that allow it to function at varying reduced levels if
damage occurs, far above presently fielded designs. The sensor pallets
are arranged in circular clusters along the lines of the saucer and in
square clusters along the sides ventral and dorsal of the engineering
hull. The main deflector itself is located along decks 30 through 33 in
the engineering hull.

### Computer and Network Systems {.title}

The Mythology comes equipped with three computer cores. The primary and
secondary cores were enhanced with bio-neural processing circuity to
speed up response times. The third core is solely made up of standard
isolinear data storage chips and processors. The primary core is located
on decks 8 through 11. The secondary core is located on decks 30 through
33. The backup core is located in the aft section of the neck areas of
the engineering hull, on decks 23 through 25.

In normal operations the combination core in the saucer handles all
primary ship operations; the second combination core handles any further
demands in normal operations as the need arises. Only when both cores
are damaged or offline does the tertiary core come online. When in
operation, it can only run critical ship systems such as life support,
engines, basic sensors, manual limited weapon targeting and navigation.

The Mythology uses bio-neural circuitry for all primary systems and a
back up isolinear network for secondary systems during normal
operations. To further improve its redundancy and survival capabilities,
the back up isolinear network is able to operate critical primary
systems if the bio-neural circuitry is compromised or damaged. To aid in
preventing infections the bio-neural circuitry uses the I-MUN Mark II
filter series.

The combination cores use the LCARS OS using the MAJEL interface. The
saucer and engineering hull cores house UHPAVS (Upgraded Hacking
Prevention and Anti Virus Scanner), as well as RSUEP (Really Stupid User
Error Prevention) data programs. However, the standard isolinear backup
core lacks this feature, as well as the more advanced functions of the
MAJEL interface. Captains commanding these ships are strongly warned to
keep genius inebriated adolescents, high risk crew members or visitors
away from consoles in such an emergency. During use of specialized
mission modules, the engineering hull combination computer core handles
all functions of the mission modules.

### Holographic Systems {.title}

The Mythology has holo-emitters situated at key points across the ship:
in this case the bridge, 17/18 forward, the gym, the cargo bays and main
engineering. This allows the ship's two EMH Mark IV programs to appear
in these areas besides the sickbays, holodecks and holosuites. The EMH
Mark IV programs are located in both the primary and secondary computer
cores. This allows two programs to be active at any given time.

Warp Propulsion Systems {.title}
-----------------------

Given the ship’s large size, and the designer’s plans to give the
Mythology class the most self reliance and sufficiency capable for long
deep space missions, it is equipped with the Class 10 warp core. The
core was retrofitted for ease of use and maintenance for long term
missions far from Federation supply and refitting yards.

This core feeds two nacelles, outputting 7,912 cocharanes, giving the
Mythology a standard cruising speed of warp 6.8, a max sustainable speed
of warp 9.6, a maximum velocity for twelve hours of warp 9.98, and an
emergency speed of warp 9.99. Due to it’s larger than usual size and
power demands, the ship is slower than others that would mount the Class
10 core.

The nacelles are mounted on variable pylons, which also house their
support systems. As with much of the ship they contain reinforced
superstructure, and both primary and secondary warp coils.

Ejection systems propel the Class 10 warp core out the top of the
engineering hull in an emergency.

Impulse Propulsion Systems {.title}
--------------------------

The Mythology houses two impulse engines. These two engines can propel
the ship to a maximum thrust of .25c in seventy-five seconds and from
full impulse to a complete stop in one-hundred fifteen seconds. The two
engines are mounted port and starboard on the aft quarter of the saucer
on decks 18 through 20. As with much of the design the reactors for
these engines are reinforced to be resistant to extended and strenuous
use far beyond more commonly used designed engines.

Tactical Systems {.title}
----------------

### Defensive Shields {.title}

The Mythology mounts the Type 10 shield system. Emitters are placed in
key positions along the whole width and breadth of the ship's frame. The
maximum graviton load that can be sustained is 2150 megawatts and a
maximum dissipation rate of 5.84 x 10\^5 kW. The shield system is also
equipped with metaphasic programming for close solar body entry and
radiation anomalies.

### Phaser Systems {.title}

The Mythology uses ten strips of Type 10 phaser arrays. They are
positioned as follows:

-   One horseshoe strip ventral and dorsal along the saucer with 200
    emitters each.
-   One strip along the underbelly of the engineering hull behind the
    main deflector with 100 emitters each.
-   One strip ventral trailing down the connecting neck, stopping above
    the warp nacelles, with 100 emitters each.
-   One strip dorsal and ventral along the aft section of the
    engineering hull, with 100 emitters each.
-   Two strips port and starboard along the aft section of the
    engineering hull with 75 emitters each.
-   Two strips port and starboard on the nacelle pylons with 50 emitters
    each.

Each strip can output 5.1 megawatts out to 300,000 kilometers.

### Torpedo Systems {.title}

The Mythology is armed with two Type 4 burst fire torpedo launchers;
each launcher is capable of firing up to 5 torpedoes every 10 seconds.
Each launcher is positioned one forward and one aft upon the engineering
hull contained in the connecting structure, on decks 35 through 37.

The ship carries 350 casings: 145 of these are for photon torpedoes, 50
for quantum torpedoes, 5 are kept empty in reserve, 5 are Tricobalt
devices, and a further 145 are for specialized probes. They have a
maximum effective range of 3,500,000 km.

Command and Support Systems {.title}
---------------------------

### Bridge {.title}

The Mythology class bridge is located on Deck 1; it is arranged in a
circular shape. The bridge is equipped with easy modular setup for
refits, repairs and replacement as time and natural wear and tear takes
its toll on the ship. The aft section of the bridge contains nine banks
of consoles, default setup from port to starboard is:

-   Support Science 1
-   Support Science 2
-   Support Science 3
-   Engineering Support 1
-   Engineering Support 2
-   Engineering Support 3
-   Miscellaneous / Auxiliary 1
-   Miscellaneous / Auxiliary 2
-   Miscellaneous / Auxiliary 3

Two rectangular consoles for the tactical and security officers are
located just forward of the wall stations. Directly starboard to the
tactical officer are the Operations and Mission Ops stations. Two small
auxiliary panels to either side of these spots can be configured for use
as needed for mission specific guests.

A guide rail circles down the middle area of the bridge. Just forward of
the railing from port to starboard are the Executive Officer, Captain,
Counselor and two mission specialist chairs. Handy flip up consoles give
critical data access to each officer and guest. In the right arm rest of
the Captain's chair is a flip up holder which contains a clip for a type
2 phaser. An optional hat, jacket or trophy rack, depending on the
Captain's preference, connects to a front baseboard of the tactical and
security consoles. Along the starboard wall of the bridge are the Helm
and 2nd officer’s stations and directly across on the port wall are the
Chief Science Officer’s and Chief Engineer’s bridge stations.

At the front of the bridge is the view screen. On either side of this
are two science related holo projector units allowing 3-D views of
interesting objects to be shown. The bridge has three turbo lifts: two
forward, one port and starboard of the view screen and one aft
starboard. Along various console edges and other places that could cause
injuries during stumbles or falls is 2.5 cm of soft foam padding.

### Ready Room {.title}

The ready room is located to the aft port of the bridge; it contains a
desk, couch, two chairs and replicator, plus small areas for personal
effects. An emergency access tube near the aft wall bulkhead behind the
CO’s desk is located in the aft portion of this room down to deck 2,
which connects to the Jeffries tubes there.

### Briefing Room {.title}

Located forward starboard of the bridge, just aft from the turbolift, is
the briefing room. This room curves around the outer edges of the
bridge. A large table able to seat twelve is present, as well as a large
display screen along the bridge facing wall. A holo projector is present
for more careful study of 3-d diagrams and simulations shown compared to
those on the bridge.

### Holding Cells {.title}

Though not normally meant to house combat prisoners or other large scale
groups of trouble makers, the Mythology nonetheless has four holding
cells. Each area can house five occupants comfortably or ten if comfort
room is not a concern. Two of these facilities are located on deck 10
port and starboard in the saucer section. Two more are located on deck
40 port and starboard. As a strict precaution in case of power loss, the
cells have an emergency five hour generator to prevent prisoner escape.
In addition each cell guard is armed with a Type 2 phaser set to wide
heavy stun under normal operating conditions.

### Security Office / Armoury {.title}

This complex is located in the aft section of decks 14 and 15 in the
saucer. From the office located in this section, the Chief of Security
has the ability to control all holding cell functions, most security
related matters to the ship, and track all security and tactical
personnel. The armoury is also along the middle portion of these decks
port and starboard, housing enough Type 2 phasers to arm the whole
ship's crew if needed, as well as 200 Type 3 phaser rifles for the
ship's security forces. This two deck complex also houses two training
rooms.

### Science Labs {.title}

All along decks 13 through 15 of the saucer are located the assorted
science labs of the Mythology class. Each of these labs also house small
holo-projectors to allow full careful 3-D study of various topics. Along
the forward port areas of deck 26 in the engineering hull are smaller
secondary support and generalized science labs. The Chief Science
Officer's office is located on deck 13 attached to the larger general
science lab complex. This office allows the CSO to maintain full control
and observation at any given time of what their staff is studying and
testing.

### Main Engineering {.title}

Main engineering runs along almost all of the central part of decks 40
to 42 with support areas along the lower reaches of decks 43 in these
same areas. The warp core raises the full height of engineering on decks
40 to 42. The Chief Engineer’s office is located on the main work area
of deck 41 facing the core. From here the officer can oversee all power
functions, status of repairs and engineering teams under their charge.

Core ejection systems for the core and antimatter pods lead up a chute
out the top of the engineering hull. As an extreme back up precaution,
there is a manual release system at the top of the core which will
engage the pressurized ejection systems, launching the core out of the
hull via a pneumatic pump system. This can be utilized in a situation
where the power required for the automatic ejection system fails, though
use of this system is a last measure, and carries a high risk of injury
to the crew member who engages it, owing to the risk of explosive gases
released.

Also contained here is the much smaller Flea'’tan Compression Relay Jump
Core module: this two deck module aligns itself to the rear of the Class
X warp core on decks 40 and 41.

Monitoring systems and consoles for each power source are also aligned
in a square around this whole double decked oval shaped room.

In an emergency this area can be converted into a secondary bridge.

Utility Systems {.title}
---------------

### Cargo Bays {.title}

The Mythology houses four large cargo bays in the saucer and two smaller
in the aft section of the engineering hull. Each cargo bay holds a
single cargo transporter each. The large primary cargo bays are situated
along the outer edge of the saucer on decks 5 and 6 two on each side.
The smaller secondary bays are located port and starboard at the aft
most areas of deck 45 in the aft quarter of the engineering hull near
the fourth shuttle bay positioned port and starboard. Each of these bays
houses an exterior door for access while in dock. These access doors are
covered by a sliding panel of duranium hull plate, which retracts when
needed. The larger primary cargo bays in the saucer can also serve as a
docking port for cargo ships if required for special sensitive cargo,
utilizing an extending airlock docking clamp.

### Tractor Beam Systems {.title}

The Mythology is equipped with two tractor emitters. The two large
tractor emitters are housed in the aft dorsal section of the engineering
hull, on deck 45, and at the front of the neck of the connecting spine
above the forward facing torpedo tube, on deck 35.

The emitters can handle a total mass of 7,500,000 metric tons out to
3,000 km.

### Transporter Systems {.title}

The Mythology has eight transporter rooms, which are each capable of
transporting six personnel at a time. Two transporter rooms are on deck
8, two are on deck 9, two are on deck 23, and two are on deck 24. Each
transporter system has a range of 40,000 km.

Two emergency 12-person transporters are located port and starboard in
the saucer on deck 18 along the central axis and another two are located
on deck 29 in the forward area of the engineering hull near the main
deflector dish, each with a range of 15,000 km.

### Turbolift Systems {.title}

The turbolift car systems run the length and breadth of all decks to
critical hub areas. The cars themselves are made from reinforced
duranium construction. Each car holds a small pack with an emergency
medical and field engineer kit in case of crew becoming trapped owing to
ship-wide catastrophe. Due to the needs of reinforcement and the storage
space needs of the emergency kits these cars are 1.3 meters in circular
radius larger then others around the Federation.

### Machine Shop {.title}

The Mythology's machine shop is located on decks 31-33 in between the
ship's 2nd and 3rd Mission Module areas.

Crew Support Systems {.title}
--------------------

### Sickbay {.title}

The Mythology houses two large sickbays in the saucer port and starboard
of deck 12. A smaller one in the engineering hull is housed on deck 39.
The larger sickbays house 50 biobeds with 5 surgery and isolation bays.
The smaller sickbay holds 25 beds with 2 small surgery and isolation
bays. All three sickbays house emergency life support and power systems
to run critical equipment for 24 hours, as well as redundant isolation
systems for airborne pathogens.

The Chief Medical Officer’s office is located in Sickbay 1 on deck 12,
able to monitor all patient and staff’s current status.

The sickbay in the engineering hull is used as a nurse's station in
normal operating conditions, except during times of yellow or red alert
status.

The ship's two EMH Mark IV programs can also be run in these locations.

### Counselling Suites {.title}

The ship's counselling offices are located on deck 11 port in the
saucer. A total of six offices are present to serve the civilian and
Starfleet crew's counselling needs.

### Holographic Entertainment Facilities {.title}

The Mythology houses five holosuites and five holodecks. The holosuites
are located along the outer edge of decks 16 and 17 of the saucer, three
to port and two to starboard. Two holodecks are located port and
starboard on deck 16, with three more holodecks located in the
engineering hull on decks 37 and 38 of the engineering hull.

### Gym {.title}

The ship's Gym is found at the forward areas of deck 17 and contains
various exercise equipment from across the Federation and allied races.
The room is able to allow work out 30 crew members at a time. The room
also has variable gravity settings for those wishing a heavier workout.
In an emergency the gym can double as a triage center for mass injuries
able to support 45 patients and medical staff.

### Recreation Hall {.title}

The ship's Recreation Hall is located directly below the ship's gym on
decks 18 and 19. The Recreation hall contains many non-holographic forms
of entertainment. These include both board and card games, two tennis
tables, two pool tables, a small 18-meter long, 3.7-meter deep pool,
four bowling lanes, and a small beverage bar. This room is able to
contain up to 50 people at any given time.

### 17/18 Forward {.title}

17/18 Forward is connected directly to the ship's gym and the Recreation
Hall at the front of the saucer section. It curves around them in a half
arc contouring to these two areas.

A full-service kitchen and galley are on the port side of the room
providing freshly prepared fare for visitors and crew alike. The room
has twelve replicators, three on each deck area port and starboard.

Deck 17 of this room has a large table to support parties seating 16
people. A small holographic display can show forms of entertainment as
well. Five smaller tables of 2 to 6 crew in size are also on this top
floor. About 26 to 30 people can be accommodated comfortably in this
area.

Deck 18 of this room is accessed by two safety stairwells angled down
from 17. This area contains 15 tables of varying size from 3 to 10 crew
in size. About 45 people can be accommodated comfortably in this area.

Large open observation windows provide scenic viewing in general
operations. During yellow or red alert statuses however, plating of
duranium slides down to aid in preventing decompression in case of hull
damage. During large scale injuries these two rooms can contain up to 50
triage patients and 25 medical staff.

### Arboretum {.title}

The Mythology contains three arboreta. A large one on deck 14 of the
saucer, and two small ones on decks 26 and 38 in the engineering hull.
All three contain various plants, herbs and flowers from across
Federation space.

Benches and paths wander through all three areas providing a true planet
like experience, which looks out upon the stars through windows, without
the need for a holodeck or suite. These areas are cared for by civilian
crew groundskeepers.

### Civilian / Family Support Shelters {.title}

Located on deck 20 of the saucer and decks 21, 37 and 38 of the
engineering hull are emergency shelter areas for non-combat crew and
civilian and family personnel.

These rooms set up to house up to 50 people each, contain emergency life
support and food storage for up to a week of survival needs. In addition
they are able to be isolated by level 10 force fields and contain
reinforced duranium walls and ceiling structures.

These areas are only used by such personnel in a case of shipwide
emergency or red alert status. During such occupation two junior
officers are assigned to each room as shelter leaders.

### Schooling Facilities / Nurseries {.title}

Located on decks 15, 16, 23 and 24 near the ship’s family quarters are
the ship’s four schooling facilities and nurseries.

These facilities are manned by civilian personnel for teaching the
children of the crew’s families and taking care of any babies among the
crew

Like the emergency family areas, these areas contain emergency life
support and food storage for up to a week of survival needs.

### Diplomatic Hall {.title}

Because many of its missions were hoped to entail first contact and
exploration beyond the bounds of Federation space, the Mythology class
is equipped with a spacious diplomatic hall capable of supporting up to
40 people at any given time. The entire hall complex is located on deck
2 of the saucer; it has a slight oval circular shape with four entry
ways, two to port two to starboard, from the turbolifts. The hall is
completely open allowing partition panels and tables to be arranged as
needs require by the crew during flight. Eight exterior viewing ports
are arranged around the hall. Finally, the hall contains floor and
ceiling mounting points for display panels, briefing screens or other
devices as needed.

### General Purpose Areas {.title}

Located on decks 20 aft in the saucer and 21 and 22 in the engineering
hull are three general purpose areas. These areas are left open and only
sparsely finished to allow the ship's crew the ability to adjust the
area's layout to suit needs while in flight. This can include anything
from spare parts storage to special personnel needs or visiting VIP
offices. The areas can be set up to accommodate any known environment
type and has the ability to produce gravity effects up to five times
Earth standard gravity.

### CO's Quarters {.title}

The CO’s Quarters are located on deck 3 starboard and are spacious and
open. The room is divided into three areas: a living and work area, a
sleeping area with private storage. The living and work area has two
couches, a table, desk and workstation with table. The bedroom has a
large king-sized bed and bathroom, complete with a three person hot tub.
Connecting to this is the CO’s storage room, allowing personal effects
to be easily on hand when wanted. This storage room is a 3x2 meter
rectangular shaped room.

### XO's Quarters {.title}

The XO’s Quarters are located on deck 3 port, and are slightly smaller
than the CO’s. The room is divided into two areas; a living and work
area and a sleeping area. The living and work area holds one large and
one small couch, a table, desk and workstation with table. The bedroom
has a king-sized bed and bathroom, with a smaller two person hot tub.

### Department Head Quarters {.title}

The DH quarters are located in a ring around deck 4. These are smaller
than the XO’s quarters and are divided into two areas; a living and work
area and a sleeping area. The living and work area holds a medium-sized
couch, a desk and workstation with table. The bedroom holds a single
queen-sized bed, bathroom and single person sized hot tub.

### Junior Officer Quarters {.title}

The JO Quarters are located all along decks 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 16, 17,
18, 19 and 20 in the saucer, as well as a smaller number on decks 25,
27, 35, 36, 44 and 45 in the forward section of the engineering hull.
These quarters hold a small living and work area with two chairs, a desk
and work station with table. The bedroom holds a twin-sized bed and
stand up sonic shower stall.

### Non-commissioned Crew Quarters {.title}

These quarters are almost the same size as the JO quarters. They house a
combination living, work, and bedroom/sonic shower stall area. They hold
a small corner table that doubles as a work area, as well as a
twin-sized bed against the wall. They are located along the middle
section of decks 27, 28, 35, 36, 44 and 45, as well as a few in the
saucer on decks 8, 10 and 11 in the middle forward areas.

### VIP Quarters {.title}

The VIP Quarters are the same size and set-up as the CO’s quarters.
There are twelve of these rooms arrayed along decks 6 and 7. These
quarters can be configured for any environment as required for the
visiting VIPs.

### General Guest Quarters {.title}

The general guest quarters are the same size and set-up as the JO
quarters. There are 25 of these quarters arrayed between decks 4, 5 and
12 in the saucer as well as another 25 in the engineering hull on decks
34 and 35. These quarters can be configured for any environment as
required for visiting people.

### Family Quarters {.title}

These are quarters sized the same as a Department Head's quarters but
set-up instead to house up to a four occupant family. They are located
on decks 15 and 16 of the saucer and 23 and 24 of the engineering hull.

Auxiliary Spacecraft Systems {.title}
----------------------------

The Mythology class holds four shuttle bays. Shuttle Bay 1 is located on
the rearward area of decks 2, 3, and 4 of the saucer. Bays 2 and 3 are
located on the neck slope of the engineering hull on decks 29 and 30.
Bay 4 is located on the underside of the engineering hull near the aft
section of the ship located on decks 43, 44, and 45.

A side note in the development of the Mythology class was the creation
and deployment of the newer Longevity class runabout.

Bay 1 holds the following auxiliary craft:

-   4 Armadillo class shuttles
-   2 Longevity class runabouts

Bay 2 holds the following auxiliary craft:

-   2 Armadillo class shuttles
-   5 Workbees

Bay 3 holds the following auxiliary craft:

-   4 Armadillo class shuttles
-   2 Longevity class runabouts

Bay 4 holds the following auxiliary craft:

-   4 Longevity class runabouts

Because of its mission of peace and exploration the Mythology is not
designed to house fighters in these bays.

Conclusion {.title}
----------

The Mythology class is one of the largest deep space exploration classes
fielded by the Federation in recent years. It is designed to handle any
number of possible mission profiles, but does not specialize in any one
category. Its primary assets are adaptability, endurance and
survivability where other ships may not be able to venture. With its
co-designed construction the Mythology embodies the best that the
Federation and her allies have to offer for the years ahead.
