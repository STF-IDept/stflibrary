History and Mission Overview {.title}
----------------------------

Starfleet has made use of fighter craft for more than three hundred
years, long before it's inception as the defensive and exploratory arm
of the Federation, largely in a role as planetary defenders and small
scale combat craft, but until the outbreak of war with the Dominion
these fighters had rarely before seen extended combat actions in space.

During the Dominion war, vast numbers of Starfleet fighter craft were
lost to the superior firepower and speed of Jem'Hadar fighters, and
despite the valiant efforts of existing craft, there were no real
equivalents that could match these enemies for sheer speed and
overwhelming rate of fire and accuracy.

Starfleet Research and Development at this time were unable to sacrifice
the time, or resources to adequately facilitate research into a
potential new fighter craft with materiel and personnel stretched almost
to breaking point in an attempt to fabricate new technologies and spare
parts to aid the front line battle forces and it was with this in mind
that the project was outsourced to the defence contract agency Wolfestar
Systems, based in the Bolian outlier systems.

Unfortunately, the Wolfestar development complex was destroyed almost
completely in the conflicts along the Bolian front in early 2374 as the
newly reassigned Sixth Fleet clashed with Dominion Forces, and the
project data was presumed lost.

In late 2378 however, recovery teams from Wolfestar's now re-established
headquarters on Bolias discovered that the backup data core maintained
in vaults deep underground had escaped almost unscathed and amongst the
recovered data were found the almost completed specifications for the
new fighter.

With approval and continued support from Starfleet Research and
Development, the project was completed in late 2380 and the lead design
advisor for Starfleet, Fleet Captain Andrew Robinson named the craft and
its class Templar, in honour of its flagship role protecting Federation
citizens rights to free travel.

The Templar Class Fighter is a multifunction red zone combat craft
capable of fulfilling a number of varied roles including, but not
limited to :

-   Fighter to Fighter combat operations.
-   Support of Capital Craft in Fighter operations.
-   Reconnaissance and Patrol of contested/hazardous regions
-   Convoy escort
-   Starbase/Outpost Support Operations
-   Quarantine enforcement operations
-   Planetary troop support and atmospheric combat operations
-   Atmospheric supply craft support

Structure and Construction {.title}
--------------------------

The primary frame of the Templar Class Fighter Craft is composed of
fabricated duranium/tritanium macrofilament truss frames connected using
transporter welding techniques. This basic framework provides physical
integrity to the craft at rest.

A secondary framework of aluminium crystalfoam stringers are phase
transition welded to the primary framework to prevent the extreme
vibrational stresses suffered at high impulse manoeuvring speeds.

Due to size and mass constraints, rather than the traditional secondary
hull provided in larger, less manoeuvrable craft, the Templar utilises
reinforcing micro extruded terminium plating, transporter welded into
the primary frameworks, themselves reinforced and separated with
polyduranide rodding.

The Templar nose is formed by a rounded, elongated triangular design,
sweeping back into shortened, but wide, equidistant wings similar to the
'Delta Flyer' of the U.S.S Voyager, widened to become a more permanent
part of the main fuselage, attaching to an aft, extended engine
compartment with a single, wide range Impulse exhaust vent.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems {.title}
----------------------------------

Previous fighter craft, such as the Argus and Peregrine Classes have
used a standard computer system adapted from the larger Shuttlecraft
Classes, and using the LCARS operating system, and the MAJEL user
interface however the nature of the Templar, and it's intended use
during high speed close combat, precludes the use of such a generalised
set of operating software, and so it was determined that a faster, more
efficient, specialised operating system and interface were required.

The Templar utilises a bioneural assisted isolinear data core, with
bioneural interlinks to all other systems, shielded with EM and graviton
reflective polyduranide sheeting to prevent system interference.

When designing the Templar Operating System, Wolfestar took into account
the need for a simplified series of command pathways that would yield
maximum speed and efficiency with minimum energy requirements and
minimum processor load. It was with this in mind that Wolfestar Computer
Innovations Systems Department created the Reduced Instruction Set
Command and Control System, or RISCCS. When tested, RISCCS surpassed all
possible expectations, processing command and control operations at an
average speed of 9,300 kiloquads/sec, more than twice the speed of an
isolinear data core utilising the LCARS operating system.

It was plain that using the standard MAJEL interface of keyboard and
voice was impractical in the high speed world of fighter combat, and to
complement RISCCS a simplified Interface was needed. It was with this in
mind that the Computer Innovations Systems Department came through once
more with the Command Operations Management Tactical control interface,
or COMTAC.

COMTAC provides a verbal interface ability, used primarily for combat
operations, able to handle complex strings of commands, including the
rerouting of power and the manipulation of shielding, weaponry,
propulsion, automated damage control systems, and all other primary and
secondary systems, displaying system status through a three dimensional
Heads Down Display across a series of chest height mounted display
panels. There is also a tactile interface that allows manipulation of
systems through the status display panels, rather than a keyboard
system, though this is used primarily in non combat operations, when
time is not a factor in systems control.

Impulse Propulsion Systems {.title}
--------------------------

The Templar is incapable of faster than light travel, as adding a Warp
Propulsion System was impractical given space constraints. Main
propulsion is provided by a single medium fusion generator, housed in
the rear third of the craft. This generator contains an auxiliary boost
system, capable of providing emergency acceleration thrust to 0.43c,
albeit for extremely short periods of time. Enough to escape a dangerous
situation or accelerate into one should the need arise. Deceleration in
comparison to acceleration using the boost system is slower. but
inescapable as the .25c impulse system isn't capable of maintaining such
a rapid pace and relativistic concerns are enhanced in a smaller craft.

Because of the increased maximum speed and the low acceleration times,
the hull is lined with more than 200 mini Inertial Dampening Field
generation units, providing over 300% more inertia dampening capability
than standard, augmented by equivalent Structural Integrity Field
generators, providing sufficient added hull integrity to survive
extended travel at .92c. Considered overkill by some, it gives the
Templar the redundancy that Wolfestar is known throughout the galaxy
for.

Due to its lack of warp capability, the Templar relies on carrier
support to ferry it from target to target, although it has a series of
magnetic grappling systems along the lower hull, which allow it to
attach itself to the outer hull of a willing vessel, tagging along as
that vessel makes a warp journey, and detaching once a destination is
reached.

Tactical Systems {.title}
----------------

### Defensive Shields {.title}

The Templar is equipped with a single modified Type IV shield generator
contained within the aft secondary spaces between the COMTAC routing
system and Computer Core. This modified system consists of a cluster of
twelve 16MW graviton polarity sources feeding a single 900 millicochrane
subspace field distortion amplifier, producing an output of 192 MW and a
maximum primary energy dissipation rate of approximately 52,123 kW,
though powering shielding at maximum levels reduces the effective output
of the main pulse phaser cannons, and is designed primarily to function
at that power level only in conjunction with the microtorpedo load in
strafing operations against larger craft. At approximately 65% of this
power rating, the main pulse phaser cannons are at maximum
effectiveness.

### Phaser Systems {.title}

Following the success of the Defiant Class weapons systems, it was
deemed appropriate by Wolfestar's Tactical Systems Department to
incorporate a similar, if less powerful design into the Templar. Above
the main nose are mounted a pair of fixed pulse phaser cannons with a
single forward firing angle. This fixture is mirrored below the nose.
altogether forming a quad set.

Due to the power requirements and overheating issues inherent in
providing such powerful primary weapons for a fighter craft, it is not
possible to fire all four cannons simultaneously for extended periods of
time, and as such, standard firing is conducted in a linear sequence, a
single barrel at a time, though they can also be linked into a dual fire
mode with reductions of up to 50% in shield power to prevent complete
power drain and for shorter periods of time, a full quad fire mode,
primarily used only on significantly larger targets.

### Torpedo Systems {.title}

Unlike other fighter craft, the Templar is designed to function as an
extended use large craft strike unit, and it was with that in mind that
the Wolfestar Ballistic Projectile Division added wings to the initial
design, that serve no aerodynamic or manoeuvring purpose, but are
instead solely intended as torpedo firing platforms.

Each wing contains a single microtorpedo tube, supplied by a high
capacity, quick loading belt system. The wings, with an internal
dimension of 16.5 cubic metres are of sufficient size to contain a
standard payload of 100 microtorpedo's each, in a reinforced magazine,
linked directly to the loading belt mechanism.

The torpedo loading system is capable of reloading the single torpedo
tube within 2.4 seconds due to its unique solid belt design, reloading
the belt behind a 24 torpedo buffer stock.

Command and Support Systems {.title}
---------------------------

Unlike similar design craft, the cockpit is hidden beneath ablative
armour reinforced shielding, sunk ahead of the main computer core, to
either side of the wings. With the seat set to an ergonomic 16 degree
rear angle, the pilot has a series of four monitor screens directly
before his eyes. Each screen in this manner links to a series of visual
sensors capable of projecting on each of these screens a visual from any
angle, though the two centre screens by default provide forward views to
aid in navigation.

Directly below these screens, requiring some minor lowering of the head
are a series of 6 smaller screens and one central larger screen
depicting primary and secondary system status in any customisable
format, though the default settings are:

-   Far Left Screen 1 - Engine Status
-   Left Screen 2 - Power Status
-   Left Screen 3 - Computer Status
-   Centre Screen - Tactical Threat Analysis Monitor - Provides
    information on all detected threats and current locations relative
    to home fighter, as well as information concerning friendly units
    and a threat analysis by grading of all vessels e.g. Capital ships
    no immediate mobile threat, fighters, immediate threat, friendly
    ships no threat. Using this method it will highlight any targets
    classified as critical threat and issue an audible warning,
    highlighting that threat on the main forward screen if visible
    within that range.
-   Right Screen 3 - Pulse Phaser Cannon Status
-   Right Screen 2 - Microtorpedo Assembly Status
-   Far Right Screen 1 - Environmental Control, Secondary Power Systems
    and Auxiliary Systems Status.

Primary flight control is provided by the standard auxiliary helm
control stick, as supplied for larger Starships. This control stick
utilises thumb and finger control mechanisms for weapons select and a
larger forefinger control to fire selected weapons. Torpedo's and
phasers can be fired, and weapons selected using the Voice COMTAC
interface, though this procedure is of course slowed by the need for
speech.

Velocity and engine power are controlled by a raised control lever,
which provides combat COMTAC access through a thumb key along the right
hand side. Depression of this key provides the same input as the "TAC"
mode of verbal address which itself is an adaptation of the more
traditional "Computer" mode of address.

Utility Systems {.title}
---------------

Because of its nature as a none warp capable fighter craft, the Templar
cockpit is designed to function as an extended duration life pod. Upon
verbal or emergency tactile request, the cockpit is blown away from the
main craft using explosive bolt devices, small, shaped, solid state
explosives, driving the cockpit, including its armour panelling away
from the craft at approximately 4 m/s. Once ejected, the cockpit systems
are powered by an emergency micro fission generator with a battery
backup, providing approximately 72 hours of continuous life support, or
300 hours if the emergency medkit is used to induce sleep.

Provided a larger friendly craft is in site, the life pod will activate,
small reaction control thrusters to propel the lifeboat at 16 m/s
towards that craft, emitting a coded or open frequency emergency
distress signal. Once within range, the larger craft can tractor the pod
in, or transport the pilot aboard.

In case of landing on a planetary or atmospheric body, the life pod
systems are capable of recharging through solar power cells. The pod
contains a three day emergency ration kit, medkit and a Type IIIa Pulse
Compression Phaser Rifle with twelve spare charged power packs.

Crew Support Systems {.title}
--------------------

The Templar utilises a standard environmental control system which
provides air to the cockpit compartment, and can be adapted to provide
air to other areas of the craft for the purposes of emergency repairs
whilst in space. Other areas are reached via small crawlways which run
the length and width of the craft, centred on the Cockpit area.

Subspace communications are provided by a modified antenna array tied
directly into the COMTAC Interface and controlled by a pad activated by
the left foot. When depressed this triggers the communications
subroutine and verbal input is required to direct encrypted
communications to a target e.g. depressing the pad and calling "Red 2"
would place the pilot in contact with the craft designated Red 2.
Communications systems can be accessed directly through Far Right Panel
1 of the status display screens, using the tactile screen interface.

Pilot ablution and sanitation facilities are provided by a series of
flight suit mounted tubing which carry waste away and recycle it using a
primitive replicator device, converting it to pure water for the pilot's
emergency supply and general convenience.

Conclusion {.title}
----------

The Templar Class Heavy Fighter is the leading edge of Starfleet's
commitments to further fighter production and is now in mass production.
Doubtless it will prove itself to be the preferred and primary
multipurpose combat fighter in use by Starfleet. Wolfestar systems have
proven themselves more than capable of matching Starfleet Research and
Development in the production of cutting edge craft and technology,
which will very likely lead to profitable partnerships in the future.

Multi purpose, simplified control mechanisms make this the future of all
further fighter designs and will no doubt become the benchmark as this
class bridges the gaps in current fighter theology and tactical
practice.
