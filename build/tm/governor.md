History and Mission Overview {.title}
----------------------------

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
wisdom, it was the age of foolishness . . . it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair . . . in short, the period was so far like
the present period . . .

—Charles Dickens

In early 2257, in response to increased Klingon presence across the
neutral zone, it was determined that an alternative to the Constitution
Class starships was warranted. A lighter, more manoeuvreable and more
rapidly constructed craft was required to patrol the neutral zone and
respond to any incursions from the faster and more manoeuvreable Klingon
Bird of Prey and its larger cousins.

Development contracts were assigned to Starfleet Research and
Development with the intent of attempting to shrink the Constitution
frame whilst increasing overall speed and sustainability whilst causing
minimum reduction in weapons usage. After six years of development and
simulation, the Research and Development technicians produced the first
draft of the Governor Class Cruiser. After careful examination it was
determined that this was a viable option and the ship went into
production immediately with a prototype rolling off the line less than
twelve months after receipt of contract. During its shakedown cruise,
deliberately sited around the Klingon Neutral Zone, a confrontation with
a Klingon D-5 cruiser which ended in victory for the Governor produced
such excited murmuring in Starfleet Engineering that it was determined
that a further twenty Governor class ships would be produced
immediately.

Whilst there was a sacrificing of weapons in the Governor, its top speed
was increased to warp 8.6 and both acceleration and deceleration times
were reduced. The introduction of more focused and automatically
adjusting inertial dampening fields and structural integrity fields give
the Governor an ability to manoeuvre faster than any other ship
currently in Starfleet service.

Intended as a rapid response unit patrolling the Romulan and Klingon
neutral zones, the Governor functions in the following primary mission
roles:

-   Neutral Zone Patrol
-   Rapid Response to Incursion
-   Group Support for Larger Battlegroups
-   Ground based combat troop transport
-   Space based support of ground operations
-   Space based shipping lane patrol

Structure and Construction {.title}
--------------------------

A heart well worth winning, and well won. A heart that, once won, goes
through fire and water for the winner, and never changes, and is never
daunted

—Charles Dickens

In appearance, the Governor consists of a saucer connected to a tubular
star drive section via a dorsal neck mounting. The twin warp nacelles
are fitted to the aft section of the secondary hull via V shaped pylons.
It is similar in appearance to the much larger Constitution Class
starship.

The Governor's hull is composed of a duranium-tritanium alloy in a 30cm
double layer separated with 15cm of enriched duraplast foam. The outer
layer of hull plating is in a state of permanent polarisation to enable
greater unprotected resistance to enemy weapons fire. The
duranium-tritanium trusses that support the outer hull are laser welded
to form a permanent support chassis.

During extreme emergency, explosive bolts are in place across the
nacelle-pylon connections and across the neck of the saucer-star drive
connections to enable either or all to be separated should it be deemed
necessary. Either the star drive or saucer section can be configured to
act as a life pod in case of disaster. An emergency impulse drive is
contained within the star drive, allowing the star drive, once separated
to operate at impulse speeds up to .15c. The saucer section is capable
of standard maximum sublight speeds, but is incapable of attaining warp
speed. Provided the warp core is viable, the star drive section will
operate at normal warp speeds after the default warp field geometry is
manually adjusted to a predetermined separation setting.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems {.title}
----------------------------------

I only ask to be free. The butterflies are free.

—Charles Dickens

Given the need for the Governor to have an active and powerful sensor
suite without the attendant scientific research facilities, a series of
200 sensors are distributed throughout the outer hull and are used for
navigational, remote sensing, tactical analysis and early warning data
collection. Each sensor can be operated independantly or in series in
both passive and active data collection mode. The whole forms the
collective 'sensor array'

The sensor array aboard the Governor is one of the most powerful in
current service, with a high resolution scan range of 1.5 light years
and a low resolution range of 6.5 light years. Through the application
of high power emissions diodes, the sensor array can be utilised as a
jamming system to prevent enemy vessels from sending or receiving
transmissions. Effective jamming range for this system at full power is
390,000km. It should be noted that effecting this jamming system also
prevents the jamming vessel from utilising their own communications
systems.

Whilst not a science vessel by design, the Governor does carry 30 empty
torpedo cases which can, at need be configured for scientific or
exploratory purposes.

Computer Systems {.title}
----------------

There were times when he could not read the face he had studied so long,
and when this lonely girl was a greater mystery to him than any women of
the world...

—Charles Dickens

The Governor is designed and built with a dual computer core system. It
is outfitted with a D-3 Duotronic primary core, and a D-2 Duotronic
secondary core. The primary core is located in the center of decks 3, 4,
and 5 of the saucer section, with the smaller back up core in the center
aft of the secondary hull of decks eleven and twelve. The function of
the secondary core has largely been relegated to simple information back
up storage. In an emergency, it can be reconfigured to operate the
Governor's primary systems such as navigation, propulsion, weapons,
shields and life support, though on a limited capacity. Each computer
core is monitored from a main Computer Room and the computer rooms are
maintained by at least two active technicians at any one time. Any
requests from the library computer must be issued through the main
Computer Room and any portable information must be copied to recorder
tapes. The only information terminals capable of accessing the library
computer without passing through the computer room are those in the
Captains Quarters, the main Conference Lounge, Main Engineering, Sickbay
and the Bridge.

The verbal user interface used aboard the Governor is the same simple
MAJEL interface familiar to all personnel. It responds to simple verbal
requests through main computer access terminals and can perform simple
tasks, though is incapable of extended factor calculation without a
tactile command input.

Warp Propulsion Systems {.title}
-----------------------

The whole difference between construction and creation is exactly this:
that a thing constructed can only be loved after it is constructed; but
a thing created is loved before it exists.

—Charles Dickens

The Governor utilizes a horizontally mounted Class-VI warp core.
Ejection protocols are in place should the core ever breach and through
the application of explosive bolting technology will occur within three
seconds. During a warp core breach, the core is ejected through a
service hatch directly aft from the Governor's secondary hull. The warp
core for the Governor is rated at 636 cochranes with a max velocity of
TOS-Warp-8.6 for 12 hours, a max sustainable velocity of TOS-Warp-8, and
a cruising speed of TOS-Warp-7.5.

NOTE: Comparison of TOS warp values and the more modern TNG-VOY warp
values can be found at:http://www.star-fleet.com/ed/warp-chart.html

Impulse Propulsion Systems {.title}
--------------------------

Cheerfulness and contentment are great beautifiers, and are fatuous
preservers of youthful looks

—Charles Dickens

The dual vent impulse drive is mounted directly aft of, and attached to
the saucer section. The impulse drive is designed to propel the ship up
to and including 0.25c, with an acceleration rate from zero to 0.25c of
14 seconds, and a deceleration rate from 0.25c to zero in 32 seconds.

An emergency impulse system is in place aboard the Governor. In the
event of saucer separation or primary fusion generator failure, a series
of three micro-fusion reactors powering three adjustable vector exhaust
vents mounted in the central neck of the secondary hull are revealed
through a group of retracting hull plates. These are capable of
propelling the ship at a theoretical maximum speed of .10c and the
separated secondary hull at a speed of .15c.

Slush deuterium fuel for the impulse and warp drives is stored in three
self pressurizing and sealing tanks, two primary tanks and one
auxiliary. The two primary tanks are located on opposing sides of the
impulse fusion reactor, Deck-6 of the Saucer Section. The auxiliary
deuterium tank is located in the center portion of Deck-8 in the
Secondary Hull. Deuterium reserves stored aboard the Governor are
sufficient for a one month cruise. After 20 days, the ship must return
to a Starbase for resupply and refuelling.

Tactical Systems {.title}
----------------

### Defensive Shields {.title}

The shielding system of the Governor consists of eight shield generators
located at key points along the space frame. Each generator is comprised
of seven 18MW graviton polarity sources feeding into a single 352
millicochrane subspace field distortion amplifier. During alert status,
the shield generators can combine to provide a continuous gravitation
load of 672 MW with a maximum primary energy dissipation rate of 1.8 x
10\^5kw.

### Phaser Systems {.title}

The Governor is outfitted with a mix of two separate phaser systems. Two
Type VII phaser emitters are mounted in the fore mid section of the
saucer section, whilst two Type VI emitters are mounted at the rear of
the star drive section. Both systems are designed to have independent
firing control. Each emitter is mounted to a swivelling turret system.
Forward phaser systems can fire in an arc 90 degrees from the horizontal
and vertical planes, providing 180 degree coverage forward of the star
drive section. The aft phasers are capable of the same, providing
coverage from the rear of the star drive section. The central portion of
the star drive section is vulnerable to attack with no side mounted
phaser systems and the ship must be reliant upon the Navigator and
Weapons Officers skill to maintain the security of the star drive
section from flanking attacks.. Each phaser bank can be operated at full
power for twenty two minutes before the batteries are drained and must
undergo a nine minute recharge cycle. As standard, the phaser batteries
are maintained at a fully charged state whilst in standby.

The Type VII phaser emitters are rated at a maximum energy output of
1.3MW with a maximum range of 75,000km.

The Type VI phaser emitters are rated at a maximum energy output of
0.6MW with a maximum range of 35,000km

### Torpedo Systems {.title}

Deck 9 is entirely occupied by the Torpedo firing systems. The Governor
utilises two torpedo tubes, both located at the forward edge of the star
drive. The loading system is semi automated and must be monitored by
groups of highly trained technicians. The torpedo systems are controlled
from the primary "Torpedo Room" located on a raised platform above the
loading docks on Deck 9. The torpedo loading system draws torpedoes from
a magazine storage bay in the rear of deck 9 through a series of
hydraulic lifting cranes. The torpedo is drawn from the magazine into
the loading area directly behind the torpedo tubes. It must then be
manually maneouvered into the tube using a locking pin which releases it
from the lifting rack. Once the inner torpedo hatch is closed, the
torpedo is locked into the launching mechanism which is capable of
tracking individually through the full 360-degrees, allowing targets
outside the firing arc of the launchers to be engaged.

The torpedo room is continually manned by at least four torpedo
technicians who monitor the status of all torpedo systems and perform
the daily maintenance required, including replacing damaged loading
runners, monitoring torsional stresses on each of the loading systems
and the weekly launcher scrubbing that is required to maintain the
system in peak efficiency.

The Governor carries a standard load of 150 photon torpedoes and 30
empty casings. Each torpedo tube has a designated load time of eleven
seconds and a standard fire rate of five torpedoes per minute. The
Governor is the first vessel to employ the new Mark-III Photon Torpedo.
This weapon has an effective range of 1,000,000 km. The warhead consists
of six frozen slugs of 300 grams each of matter and antimatter in
magnetic suspension. Typical detonations yield the equivalent of 84.6
megatons. However, due to minute variations in the amount of
matter/antimatter particles which begin the annihilation reaction,
detonation yield may vary by an average of ten percent. Forcefield
attenuation of the blast yields a shaped charge effect, allowing the
total destructive energy to be unleashed on a desired target.

Command and Support Systems {.title}
---------------------------

### Bridge {.title}

The Governors bridge in layout is similar to that of its larger cousin,
the Constitution. At center is the Captain's chair, with the Helmsman
and Navigator's seats directly ahead. These three areas rest in a sunken
area with a railing running partway around the circumference. Directly
behind and to the right of the Captain is the main entrance to the
Conference Lounge. To the right of that are the science and
communications stations. To the right of these is the main turbolift
access and finally the main engineering station and systems monitoring
station, occupying the wall to the Captains left. The viewscreen
occupies the entire forward wall of the Bridge. Although there is no
designated seat for the First Officer, as he is traditionally a
Department Head himself, it is assumed that he will be manning one of
the duty stations located through out the Bridge. The Bridge is located
at the center of deck 1.

### Auxiliary Control {.title}

The Auxiliary Control Room is located on deck 4. It is continually
manned and maintained by four junior officers. In the event of a ship
wide catastrophe, all the major ship's functions can be controlled from
here. In layout it is similar to the main bridge but smaller and without
the sunken area or railing.

In the star drive, Main Engineering serves as auxillary control, with
primary systems being routed through a control room located just off the
Chief Engineers office. A small viewscreen operates in the same capacity
as its larger cousin and this control room can be manned by as few as
four people. This control room has customisable stations capable of
controlling each of the ships primary functions, but in four person mode
the default stations are Navigation/Tactical, Conn and Science.

### Armoury {.title}

The Ship's armoury is located on Deck 8, directly above the Torpedo
Room. The armoury is stocked with a usual complement of 50 Type-I hand
phasers, 100 Type-II hand phasers, 100 Type-III phaser rifles, 75 sets
of body armor, 120 Anastazine gas grenades, 120 concussion grenades, and
120 photon grenades. Access to the armoury is highly restricted. Only
the ship's CO, XO, all the Department Heads, and the Security staff have
access to the armoury, and this is granted only after a DNA palm print
scan. The armoury is laid out in racks, each labelled and catalogued.
Inventory of armoury and weapons lockers contents is taken at the
beginning of each duty shift and compared to a master readout contained
within a secure section of the main library database. The armoury is
continually manned by a pair of security officers.

To protect against a hostile boarding of the ship, there are also
several weapons lockers strategically placed in prominent areas of the
ship. These areas include the Auxiliary Control, Bridge, Brig, Main
Engineering, all the Transporter Rooms, the Shuttlebay, and the Torpedo
Room. During normal operations, only the Command and Security staff (as
stated for the armoury) may gain access to the lockers. During yellow or
red alert status, any ship's crewmember may gain access via DNA thumb
print verification. Each locker contains 12 Type-II hand phasers, two
tricorders and twenty four spare power packs with an effective life of
forty five maximum setting shots each.

### Brig {.title}

Located on Deck 10, the Brig is comprised of five cells, a common
"watch" area and COS's office. The "watch" area is nothing more than a
duty station in which a security officer can stand watch over the
prisoners. Each cell is equipped with a small "drum" dispenser for the
secure transfer of items and food both to and from the cell. The drum
has an opening on only one section of its curved surface, and is made
out of a 1cm thick sheet of duranium alloy, which in turn is mounted to
a framework of solid duranium that extends 25.0cm with in the bulkhead
of the wall. Once an object is placed with in the drum, the drum is
rotated so that its opened section "faces" the opposite side of the
wall. For reasons of security, the controls for the drum dispenser are
placed on the "watch" duty station and not with in the detention cell
itself. This is to prevent a prisoner from escaping his cell by using
the drum dispenser to gain access to his cell controls. There is a
single protein resequencer mounted near the "watch" duty station and is
totally inaccessible to cell occupants. The protein resequencer is
capable of transforming bulk protein into a variety of simple chain food
stuffs such as ice cream, meats and potatoes.

The cells themselves utilise a series of two recessed forcefield
generators which deliver a painful, but relatively harmless shock to
anyone who touches the field whilst active. When activated, the
generators slide into place and glow with a soft yellow light. This
allows the watch officer to continually monitor the cells occupants
without allowing an opportunity to escape.

Also housed in the Brig is the ship's vault. The vault is a secured
storage compartment which can be used to safely store information and
evidence in a criminal investigation, sensitive mission specific
material or information that can not be stored in the ship's cargo bay
or the ship's computers, currency, or personal items for the crew and
passengers. The vault is separated into a safe, and 100 locked boxes.
Either the safe or the boxes can be individually preset to its own lock
combination and climate controls. Access to the vault is granted only by
senior officer identification. This identification is verified by voice
print, optical retina scan, and palm print. All three must be successful
for the senior officer to gain access to the vault.

### Main Engineering {.title}

Main Engineering is located near the center of the secondary hull on
Decks 11 and 12. On either end of the compartment is a single three man
turbolift which only operates within Main Engineering itself. The warp
core lays horizontal along the floor of Deck 12 and runs from fore to
aft, separated from the main engineering bay by a series of hatchwork
grids. The Chief Engineer's office is located on the forward end of the
Engineering compartment on Deck 11 and is situated so that the Chief
Engineer can oversee the operation of his department through another
series of hatchwork grids.

The Chief Engineers office has a set of monitoring screens directly
behind his desk which provide customisable readouts listing the status
of any of the primary systems aboard ship. His desk contains a main
library access terminal, a communications panel and a series of switches
which provide access to all primary system readouts.

Utility Systems {.title}
---------------

There is a wisdom of the head, and... a wisdom of the heart.

—Charles Dickens

### Cargo Bays {.title}

The main cargo bays are located in the lower aft section of the
Secondary Hull between the shuttlebays, and the main deflector dish.
There are four cargo holds in total. Each cargo bay is equipped with two
entrances, one opening towards outer space for offloading via work bee,
shuttlecraft, or space dock. The second entrance is a dual access
airlock opening into the ship's corridor. The airlock acts as a buffer
between the cargo hold and the rest of the ship. Each cargo hold is
compartmentalized, and can be configured to provide either a H, K, L, M,
N, or N(2) environment for the safe storage of perishable cargo or to
house life forms that exist in terrestrial environments other than
Class-M. This design gives the ship the capability of storing perishable
cargo or housing life forms in their proper environment.

A further three cargo areas are located on decks 3 and 4 in the saucer
section, with the same outward facing loading airlock and the inner
double airlock. The saucer section cargo bays are used for storing spare
parts for the impulse systems and emergency damage control equipment for
the saucer section.

### Tractor Beam Systems {.title}

There are two tractor beam projectors located fore and aft, the fore
emitter is located across the neck of the saucer section, the aft
emitter between the aft phaser emitters at the rear of the star drive.
Effective range of the tractor beams is 22,500km, depending on local
relativistic and delta-v conditions.

### Transporter Systems {.title}

There are a total of 4 transporters designed into the Governor's deck
plan. There are two standard six pad transporters, one on deck 2
directly beneath the main bridge and one on deck 10 in the star drive.
In addition, there are two ten pad emergency transporters. One is
located near sickbay in the saucer section, and the other is positioned
with in the secondary hull. Ranges of the standard transporters are
30,000km, while that of the emergency and cargo transporters are only
11,250km respectively. The transport sequence aboard the Governor takes
13 seconds, start to finish. The emergency transporter systems also
operate as troop deployment systems, allowing a rapid force deployment
capability. This allows a maximum troop deployment rate of 32 troops
every 30 seconds. The emergency transporters, by design, are outbound
transport only because of the inability to target that many individual
comm signals at a single time.

### Turbolift Systems {.title}

There are 7 operational turbolifts. Turbolift-1 is located in the center
of the Saucer Section and has access from Deck-1 of the Saucer all the
way to Deck-12 of the Secondary Hull. Turbolift-2 is also located in the
center of the Saucer, parallel with Turbolift-1, and has access from
Deck-2 of the Saucer through Deck-12 of the Secondary Hull. Turbolifts-3
and 4 have access from Deck-3 through Deck-6 of the Saucer Section, and
are located port and starboard respectively. Turbolifts-5 and 6 are
located port and starboard of the center of the secondary hull and
traverse from deck-9 to deck-12. Turbolift-7 is a cargo turbolift. It is
located in the aft section of the Saucer and has access from Deck-3
through Deck-12 of the Secondary Hull, and can traverse to each of the
three main Cargo Holds as well as each of the secondary cargo bays
located in the saucer section. Each of the turbolifts is capable of
traversing horizontally as it approaches the secondary hull. The
horizontal shafts attached to each deck allow a turbolift to grant
access to every deck without the need to use more than a single lift.

With the exception of turbolift one, which is dedicated solely to
servicing the Bridge, every other turbolift operates on computer
controlled schedules that allow them to operate without a collision.
This can occasionally lead to delay times whilst one lift waits for
another to clear a shaft, but there has been only a single recorded
accident in the life of the Governor project.

Crew Support Systems {.title}
--------------------

Look round and round upon this bare bleak plain, and see even here, upon
a winter's day, how beautiful the shadows are! Alas! it is the nature of
their kind to be so. The loveliest things in life, Tom, are but shadows;
and they come and go, and change and fade away, as rapidly as these!

—Charles Dickens

### Crew Quarters {.title}

Enlisted Crewmen and Junior Officers are billeted in pairs, each sharing
a small common lounge area and bathing facilities with separate bunk
areas. The lounge is equipped with a dining booth module, and a work
station that can double as an entertainment center. The bathroom is
equipped with a sink, toilet, and shower. The crewmen each receive a
bunk within their own separate area. This area consists only of a small
closet, single bunk style bed and a small chest of drawers. Senior
Officers fair slightly better in that they do not have to share their
living space with another officer. But their stateroom, sleeping
arrangement, and bathing facilities are of the same design as the other
Junior Officers. The Captain, Executive Officer, and visiting VIP's fair
much better. Each has a dining module roughly 25% larger then the junior
officers, a bathroom with a whirlpool bath, shower, and a bedroom large
enough for a walk in closet, a full sized bed, and a large
work/entertainment station. Only the Captain, Executive Officer, and
V.I.P. quarters are outfitted with food dispensers similar to the ones
found in either of the crew lounges.

### Crew Recreational Facilities {.title}

There are two crew lounges located in the forward most part of the
saucer section on Deck 5 and just forward of Main Engineering on Deck
10. Each lounge is capable of seating one hundred people at any given
time in some good comfort. Under usual conditions, there is a movie
shown on the large display screen twice a week for the crew's enjoyment
in each lounge, although programming is subject to Captain's discretion.
Also located in the Lounge is a well stocked and fully equipped games
locker. The default game supplies include a wide range of portable table
top games for the crew to use at their leisure. The locker may be
stocked with such games as Three Dimensional Chess, Battleships, Kalto,
Three Dimensional Scrabble, Monopoly: the Federation Edition and several
decks of cards in varying cultural styles.

There is a private mess for receiving VIP's and hosting senior officers
located on deck 2, though its use is largely dependant upon the Captain
of the day. This dining area has a separate galley preparation area and
an entertainment screen suitable for displaying broadcasts of many
types. The private dining area is capable of seating fifteen comfortably
and is generally staffed by the Captains personal steward, two
understewards and two sous chefs.

### Gymnasium {.title}

There is a large gymnasium located on the lower aft section of Deck 6.
It is equipped with a sparring ring for boxing/wrestling/fencing or
other forms of hand to hand combat, and cardiovascular and weights
machinery to keep the crew in peak physical condition. Should the
situation arise, the Gymnasium's equipment can be easily stored, thus
opening up the room's area to be used as an auditorium or act as an
auxiliary storage room or stage area for theatre performances. At any
given time, the gymnasium can comfortably contain forty people, though
in theatre configuration it can easily handle eighty, the standard off
duty complement at any given time.

### Galley {.title}

Located near the center of Deck-4 is the ship's Galley. Although capable
of reproducing a variety of food selections, the Governor Class is
equipped with both a food synthesizer system, and a fully functioning
Galley. Food stuffs for the Galley are stored in three separate fully
compartmentalized pantries, each compartment equipped with their own
stasis field generators to preserve freshness. This provides something
of an alternative to the standard cubed nutritional supplements offered
by the food synthesizer system.

The food synthesizer system is comprised of a matter re-sequencer system
connected to the waste reclamation system. The matter re-sequencer
recycles biological waste materials into simple protein and sucrose
compounds in taste similar to meat/ dairy/ vegetable byproducts such as
ground beef, fish or poultry, cheeses, fruit juices and preserves but in
appearance simple multicoloured cubes. Although highly efficient, the
re-sequencer is incapable of creating food stuffs with a complex layered
formation as found in a turkey leg (with fat, bone and skin attached to
the meat), or the fibrous consistency of fresh fruits and vegetables.

Galley prepared or processed synthesized food stuffs are distributed via
a computer controlled network of food dispensers. Any materials left
over from the meal such as the dinner ware, or undigested food stuffs
placed back into the dispenser are automatically recycled into the waste
reclamation system. Each dispenser consists of a closed circuit micro
transporter mounted as an enclosed wall unit in specified areas through
out the ship. These areas include: the Brig, the crew lounge, the
Captain's, XO's, and VIP's quarters, Main Engineering, Sickbay, the
Shuttlebay.

### Medical Facilities {.title}

The ship's Sickbay is located on Deck-5, next to the primary computer
core in the center of the saucer section, and is the most highly
protected section in the entire ship. Sickbay is comprised of two
examination rooms separated by a surgical room, which in turn is also
bordered by a recovery room. Each examination room is outfitted with two
biobeds. The surgical room is similarly outfitted with two bio beds,
which are in turn modified specifically for delicate surgical
procedures. The recovery room is outfitted with twelve bio beds that are
designed more for a patient's comfort and recovery. In addition, there
is an emergency aid station located on every deck near the turbolift
entrance. Each aid station is nothing more then an equipment locker
housing three gurneys, and two fully stocked emergency first aid kits.

The Chief Medical Officer's office is located between the two main
examination rooms. It consists of a small laboratory setup for testing
as well as a chemical synthesizer unit capable of producing almost any
form of base chemical compound with a ready library of almost all
current medicinal products available throughout the Federation. The CMO
also has a desk with communications panel, computer access terminal and
a series of screens across the wall above it which provide visual feeds
to the examination and recovery rooms.

### Troop Transport Systems {.title}

In its role as a troop transport, the Governor can convert its cargo
bays, shuttlebays and common areas using portable camp beds and support
up to 1100 troops in reasonable comfort, before power and resource
strains begin to place the ships operating capacity at risk. Troop
transport deployments at maximum capacity, whilst rare, are time limited
to a five day transport range due to the enhanced strain on waste
reclamation, life support and perishable resources.

Look round and round upon this bare bleak plain, and see even here, upon
a winter's day, how beautiful the shadows are! Alas! it is the nature of
their kind to be so. The loveliest things in life, Tom, are but shadows;
and they come and go, and change and fade away, as rapidly as these!

—Charles Dickens

As stated before, the shuttlecraft landing bay is located aft of the
secondary hull. The launch bay is comprised of a double set of doors as
a safe guard against mechanical failure or damage suffered from combat.
The Governor's Shuttlebay is large enough to handle the maintenance and
offloading requirements for a standard complement of three shuttle
craft. The bay is capable of launching a single shuttle craft at a time.
During normal operations, as the double bay doors are opened, the
shuttlebay is depressurized, allowing safe passage.

Conclusion {.title}
----------

With the arrival and deployment of the Governor Class Destroyers, it is
hoped that the Neutral Zones between the Federation and the Romulan and
Klingon Empires will remain in place, unbreached and quiet. The Governor
is the new deterrent, a rapid attack force of powerful and manoeuvreable
ships that can respond more rapidly than any other ship currently in
Starfleet service.
