        <p>The wearable tricorder is based on tricorders used by the Saia people of planet Vag. This device is designed to give the user an easy to use device that frees up his hands for other tasks.</p>
        <p>The device comprises of a main unit, and a power pack that is strapped to the belt.</p>
        <div class="section" title="Main Unit">

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>The main unit is constructed of three pieces: the main processor housing; a connecting piece that curves around the face; and a retinal imager, attached to the end of the connecting piece, that is similar to what the Dominion use to pilot their ships. The device stays in place by a strap that goes over the head. The device comes in right and left eyed versions, depending what eye is dominant.</p>
          <p>The main processor housing is oval-shaped, and is about 10.2 x 6.5 x 3.17cm (Length, Height, Depth); the connecting piece is adjustable, with the maximum dimensions being 11.2 x 1.9 x 1.2cm; and the retinal imager is 3.4 x 1.4 x 2.1cm, all of the pieces being composed of gamma-strengthened polyduranide. The mass of the entire unit is about 127.4 grams (0.28087lbs).</p>
          <p>The processors is a reduced-size processors borrowed from the TR-590 Tricorder X.  They have a rated speed of 280 giga-floating point (GFP) calculations a second. There are also 6 wafers of densified cromopolymer isolinear crystals for a storage capacity of 8.9 kiloquads of storage.</p>
          <p>Communications are handled by a communicator with a maximum range of forty thousand kilometers. </p>

          <p>The power cell is an induction-rechargeable sarium-krellide energy cell with a rating of 22 hours continuous use and an average power level of 14.3 watts. It is contained in a housing that is also composed of gamma-strengthened polyduranide, the dimensions being 9.5 x 7.62 x 2.84cm. The unit weighs about 150.6 grams. The power cell fits in the holster normally designed for carrying standard tricorders. It connects to the headpiece by a 65cm cord that retracts into the power cell housing. In case the cable is broken, the unit is able to transmit power via a subspace power linkup to the head unit, with a 20% loss of power and usage time.</p>

          <p>There are 295 mechanical, EM, and subspace sensors in the tricorder.  123 sensors are imbedded in the connecting piece and the retinal scanner with a scanning arc of 3/4 of a degree, allowing the user to scan an area just by looking in that direction. The other 172 omnidirectional sensors are within the main processor housing.</p>

          <p>The user interfaces with the tricorder by speaking commands, which are picked up by a microphone under the retinal imager. The microphone is sensitive enough to hear whispered commands as well. The User can also use 3 customizable buttons located on the side of the main processor housing. The output is routed through the retinal imager, which scans an image onto the user's retina. Output can also be sent by audio, through a speaker located on the inner surface of the main processor unit. The main processor unit and clip are padded to maximize comfort.</p>

          <p>There are two versions of the WTR, the standard version, and the medical version. Both versions are the same, except for the fact that the medical version has primarily biological sensors. The separate sensor found in hand-held tricorders is not needed due to increased resolution in the WTR's sensors.</p>
