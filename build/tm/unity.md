History and Mission Overview {.title}
----------------------------

In 2161, a charter was signed to create a new community of peaceful
expansion and exploration by unifying the worlds of Andoria, Earth,
Tellar and Vulcan under the banner of the United Federation of Planets,
a governing body created for the benefit of all member races and the
understanding of all sapient life.

The birth of the Federation came after a war that had devastated the
Earth Starfleet, which had yet to regain its full strength. The
newly-united Federation Starfleet looked at already-approved designs,
and decided to authorize several variants of existing designs to
diversify the abilities of the fleet. One design selected for
modification was the Daedalus-class cruiser, which had proven its worth
during the War. Starfleet decided to commission a heavier cruiser
variant of the Daedalus design.

So on the eve of August of 2161 final approval began for the
construction of the Unity class heavyweight cruiser at the Sol 2,
Andoria 3, Tellar 5, and Vulcan 1 shipyards in each of these systems.

### Mission Profiles {.title}

The Unity class cruiser is suited to the following mission profiles:

-   Command and control of fleet level functions.
-   Mid to long range patrols, surveys and exploration.
-   Diplomatic and first contact functions.

Structure and Construction {.title}
--------------------------

The Unity class spans 10 decks, it has a forward mounted spherical
saucer connected by a rod shaped 'neck' to a cylindrical shaped
engineering hull which connects to a V shaped 25 degree angled set of
cylindrical warp nacelles.

The Unity class is constructed of tempered titanium steel along its
whole frame. The ship has a double layered hull, fused with nickel-steel
molded in between. Average hull thickness for each layer is 3.0
centimeters. As a secondary layer of protection 2.0 centimeters of
titanium steel plates were layered along the outward hull, this gives
the Unity class a lighter gray color then other Starfleet ships. The
ship’s deflector array is positioned under the middle of the saucer by a
circular shaped inset.

If required the Unity class is capable of making atmospheric entry and
flight, though is not capable of landing. Deceleration from orbit to
atmospheric flight takes one minute thirty seconds and a return to orbit
around two minutes.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems {.title}
----------------------------------

The Unity class mounts a sensor system designed by Vulcan and Human
engineers. The FRSS-1 sensor system has a low resolution range of 5
light years and a high resolution range of 2.5 light years.

Computer and Network Systems {.title}
----------------------------

The Unity contains a single, Human and Tellarite designed, three deck
FCC-1 series isograted computer core. It is mounted on decks D through F
along the ship's central line from the bridge. A hard line connection
series of sub-processors, connects the helm, science and tactical
stations directly into the core for increased response times.

Warp Propulsion Systems {.title}
-----------------------

The warp core for the Unity was designed by Human and Vulcan engineers,
co-working for once side by side as equals they created the first
successful Warp 7 engine. The core is powered by 392 Cochranes, with a
cruising speed of TOS-Warp 3.0, a maximum sustainable speed of TOS-Warp
4.0, a maximum velocity speed of TOS-Warp 6.3 for 12 hours and an
emergency speed of TOS-Warp 7 for 2 hours.

This core feeds the ship’s two nacelles and is mounted horizontally on
the middle sections of decks I and J. The ship’s ejection systems drop
the core out the bottom of the ship by a swing door assembly in the
engine room.

Impulse Propulsion Systems {.title}
--------------------------

The Unity mounts a single dual channel impulse engine mounted on the aft
middle sections of the saucer on decks D and E. The engine can propel
the ship to max impulse of .16c in 75 seconds and a full stop in 90
seconds.

Tactical Systems {.title}
----------------

### Defensive Shields {.title}

Utilizing an a new series of shield systems from Andorian designers
assisted by Vulcan designers the FSS-1 shield system has a maximum
dissipation rate of 2.19 x 10\^5 kW and a maximum graviton load of 400
Megawatts. The system is nearly 40% more efficient than those found on
most Earth-Romulan war and earlier era vessels.

### Hull Polarization System {.title}

The hull polarization system for the Unity is an improved variant of
that found on the NX class Explorer during the war. As such it has a
maximum dissipation rate of 4.8 x 10\^4 kilowatts and improves the hull
rating by over 150%. Human and Andorian designers created this improved
polarization system which is used as a secondary defensive system for
the Unity.

### Phaser Systems {.title}

The Unity mounts 12 of the new Type-1a phaser banks exact coverage is as
follows:

-   1 phaser bank port and starboard dorsal and ventral on the saucer
    with 180 degree coverage and 90 degree firing arc, with two emitters
    per bank.
-   2 phaser banks forward and aft mounted dorsal and ventral on the
    saucer with 90 degree coverage and 180 degree firing arc, with three
    emitters per bank.

The phaser banks have a maximum range of 35,000 km and maximum energy
output 1.0 megawatts.

### Torpedo Systems {.title}

The Unity mounts 3 Mark-1c photon torpedo launchers, their exact
coverage is as follows:

-   2 photon launchers forward on deck D.
-   1 photon launcher aft on deck D.

The photon torpedoes have a maximum range of 200,000 km. The ship as a
general load out carries 80 casings, divided into 60 torpedoes and 20
scientific probes.

Command and Support Systems {.title}
---------------------------

### Bridge {.title}

The bridge of the Unity is located on deck A, arranged in a half circle.
Stationed in the center on a slightly raised platform is the CO’s chair.
To port of the CO are the tactical and engineer stations with an
attached aux station behind them. To starboard of the CO are the science
and communication stations. Forward of the CO is the helm station and
behind the CO are three aux stations set up for commanding fleet level
functions, mission specific needs or auxiliary personnel.

### Briefing Area {.title}

Just behind these three auxiliary stations is a drop down mission
briefing table with another two aux stations. Forward of the helm
station is the bridge view screen, and to either side of it are two
turbolifts.

### Ready Room {.title}

Just starboard of the forward turbolifts is the CO’s ready room. This
room has a console, work area, and fold down couch and chair, with a
small area set aside for personal effects on two shelves.

### Brig {.title}

The ship’s four cell brig is located on deck D port side. They are
spacious enough to hold up to 20 people collectively without trouble.
Each door contains triple bolted hard locks that require outside access
to open.

### Armory {.title}

The ship’s armory is located on the forward areas of deck E and F. This
two deck room contains manual fire control and loading of the ships
photonic torpedoes and maintenance areas for the ship’s phaser banks.
This room also contains weapon lockers with 45 phaser rifles, 24 phaser
pistols, and 1 land-based phaser cannon, as well as areas to maintain
these personal weapons. The armory was designed by Andorian and Earth
designers.

### Engine Room {.title}

The ship’s engine room is located on the middle areas of decks H-J in
the engineering hull. This three deck room contains the ship’s
horizontally mounted warp core, with ejection systems on deck J dropping
the core out of the ship in an emergency via a hanger-like set of drop
doors. Fourteen consoles here show readouts on all power feeds and
current ship status. A small 2x3 meter room located on the port side of
the engine room is reserved for the personal use of the ship’s chief
engineer. The engine room was designed and set up by Human and Tellarite
designers.

### Science Labs {.title}

Meant as a full time science vessel specifications called for along the
port areas of deck D the ship's four general and four specialized
science labs. The Chief science officer office is located in general lab
1. The specialized labs were designed and set up solely by Vulcan
designers.
