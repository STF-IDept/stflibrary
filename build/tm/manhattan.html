        <p>The 2380s saw Starfleet rededicate itself to its exploratory and scientific research missions. Waves of new science-oriented ships were commissioned and launched, at a rate almost reminiscent of combat-oriented ships during the Dominion War. Most of these new science ships were small, designed for exploration, finding new and interesting things, and making notes of them. This left a gap in the market for larger ships designed to follow up on the discoveries of the smaller exploratory ships, and spend a long time studying them.</p>
        <p> In 2383, engineers at AST Shipyards presented initial design concepts for the Manhattan-class Heavy Researcher to a panel of senior officers at Starfleet Engineering. The AST engineers recognized that Starfleet's current dominant Researcher-type vessel, the Chimera-class, was a ship class built on a modified (that is to say, gutted) Dreadnought platform. The Manhattan-class, by contrast, would be designed from Day 1 with scientific research in mind. The project was given prototype approval, and the AST engineers returned home to begin final design and construction.</p>
        <p> The USS Manhattan, NCC-88000, debuted on Stardate 13073.0 to satisfactory review. Starfleet placed an order with AST for an additional nine ships of the class.</p>

        <p>he Manhattan-class is a large ship that generally conforms to Starfleet design norms: it has a saucer section and a mostly-separate stardrive section housing most Engineering systems, and is made with a hull of a duranium/tritanium alloy. There are six decks that span both sections: Decks 7-12.</p>
        <p>The Manhattan-class' saucer section is a fully rounded dish, similar to that of the Galaxy-class. It comprises the first twelve decks of the ship (with parts of Decks 7-12, as mentioned above, continuing into the stardrive section) and contains the bulk of the ship's scientific equipment and personnel space. The saucer section is a full 350 meters in diameter.</p>
        <p>The stardrive section is a 150m wide, cigar-shaped body with 75m wide, angled neck on top of it that connects the stardrive to the saucer. The front of the stardrive on the lower four decks is cut at an angle to house and protect the ship's deflector dish, while the rear of the stardrive on the lower four decks is cut at an angle for aesthetic reasons. The ship's nacelle pylons emerge from a point just aft of the beginning of the neck on Deck 18. The pylons go out for 50m on each side, then up another 20m where they join with the nacelles in airspace near Deck 14. The stardrive section is 350 meters long, and has eighteen decks, six of which are shared in part with the saucer, for a total deck count of twenty-four decks.</p>
        <p>The saucer section is connected by multiple hardpoints to the stardrive on Decks 7-12. In an emergency, a Manhattan is capable of separating its saucer section from the stardrive. Magnetic locks on the hardpoints are disengaged by computer command once a hard seal has been established on all access points between the two sections. As the separation occurs via magnetic release and not explosive separation, the two sections can reconnect once the emergency has passed.</p>

          <p>The Manhattan-class is equipped with Type X sensors capable of seeing 5 light-years out from the ship on a high-resolution scan, and 17 light-years on low-resolution. The Manhattan-class sensor suite includes the ability to perform multiphasic scans, as well as multiphase buffers to enhance the sensors' information-gathering abilities. The ship's main sensor pallets are located on Deck 2, with a secondary sensor array located on Deck 18 for use by the stardrive section in the event of a saucer separation.</p>

          <p>The Manhattan-class requires a large amount of computing power to handle its various scientific operations. The computer systems on board the ship are some of the largest on any Starfleet vessel, regardless of type. The Main Computer is made up of six isolinear-based cores containing well over 100,000 isolinear chips in total, for a total of nearly 50 million teraquads of data storage in the Main Computer alone. The Manhattan's main computer is capable of sustaining 700 trillion calculations per nanosecond. Each of the six Main Computer cores is linked to the others by bio-neural circuitry to speed up processing time. Manhattan-class ships carry additional bio-neural gel packs in storage if needed. The Main Computer is located on Decks 13-15.</p>
          <p>In addition to the main computer core, each science lab has a 1,000-isolinear-chip computer core to store pertinent experiment information without taking space from the main computer. There are 21 of these cores located throughout the ship, and each is linked to the ship's Optical Data Network, allowing them to send information to other labs or to the ship's main computer core if long-term storage is needed.</p>

        <p>To compensate for the heavy, high-end scientific loadout, reductions were made in other systems across the ship, including the Warp Core.</p>
        <p>The Manhattan is equipped with a mid-range Class-7 Warp Core producing 1,649+ Cochranes of energy. The Warp Core is located on Decks 16-20, in Main Engineering. Its Matter/Antimatter Reactor Assembly is fueled by deuterium stored in tanks on Deck 15 and anti-deuterium stored in magnetically-contained tanks on Deck 21. There is no corridor access to either fuel storage area. Security-coded doors in Main Engineering provide controlled access for maintenance.</p>
        <p>The Warp Core feeds drive plasma to the ship's two nacelles. The Manhattan is capable of a cruising speed of Warp 6.0, a maximum sustainable speed of Warp 9.0, and a maximum 12-hour speed of Warp 9.2. In an extreme emergency, the Warp Core can speed the ship up to Warp 9.5, but this speed can only be sustained for approximately an hour before major damage is done to the warp coils and the plasma injector assemblies.</p>
        <p>Manhattan-class ships are capable of ejecting their Warp Core. Upon the command of the senior duty Engineer, the fuel linkages are sealed and the Warp Core is fired by pneumatic pistons down a shaft to exit through a ventral hatch, leaving the ship through the bottom of Deck 24.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The Manhattan class has three impulse engines: two located in the saucer section to enable it to maneuver while separated from the stardrive, and one in the stardrive to provide impulse propulsion while separated from the saucer. The two engines in the saucer are the primary impulse drives for the ship when it is in one piece, but the third may also be activated to provide extra thrust.</p>
        <p>The two saucer section engines are located aft on Decks 5-6, one port side and one starboard. They are each powered by two deuterium-fusion reactors, with fuel tanks located on Deck 4. The stardrive engine is located in the neck on Decks 13-15. It is also powered by two deuterium-fusion reactors, which take their fuel from the same deuterium tanks on Deck 15 which feed the Warp Core.</p>
        <p>When solely powered by the two saucer engines, the Manhattan can achieve a speed of .2c. When all three engines are active, the maximum speed increases to .25c. It takes the ship 45 seconds to achieve this maximum speed from a dead stop, and 70 seconds to go from .25c to a dead stop.</p>

          </div>
          <p>The designers of the Manhattan-class opted for a balanced approach to selecting torpedo/probe launching systems for the ship. While the new design standards allowed them to have six standard torpedo/probe launchers or two of the larger multi-load/fire launchers, they opted to use three standard launchers and one "burst fire" launcher.</p>
          <p>The three standard launchers are located on Decks 18 and 19. One (on Deck 18) faces aft, while the other two (on Deck 19) face forward. The burst fire launcher is located on Deck 12, in a hull bubble on the underside of the saucer section.</p>
          <p>Since the launchers are so spread out from each other, the Manhattan-class has two storage bays for photon torpedoes and probes. Torpedo Bay 1 is located on Deck 11 and holds 100 torpedo casings. 50 are designated for photon torpedoes, 25 are pre-assembled standard probes, and the remaining 25 are customizable probes used as needed by the Science Department.</p>
          <p>Torpedo Bay 2 is located on Deck 18 and feeds all three of the standard single-shot launchers. It holds the ship's remaining 100 torpedo casings. Like Torpedo Bay 1, 50 casings are designated for use as photon torpedoes, 25 are pre-assembled standard probes, and the remaining 25 are customizable probes used as needed by the Science Department.</p>
          <p>As a Science vessel, the Manhattan-class does not carry quantum torpedoes.</p>

          <p>The Manhattan-class Bridge, like most Federation starships, is located on Deck 1. Unlike some modern starships with a holographic viewscreen projected onto the forward wall, the Manhattan-class uses the tried-and-true physical viewscreen mounted on the forward wall. The viewscreen is 4 meters tall and 3 meters wide, and is capable of displaying as many as 16 different feeds simultaneously.</p>
          <p>Forward of the viewscreen is the Conn console, with a mid-backed swivel seat for the manning officer. The Conn console is responsible for piloting the ship, handling both helm control and navigation. The Conn officer is responsible for inputting the desired values for the ship's pitch, yaw, roll and speed manually, or selecting from a pre-programmed menu of maneuvers.</p>
          <p>Behind the viewscreen, mounted at the top of a gently-sloped ramp area, is the Command platform, with seating for the ship's Commanding Officer, Executive Officer, and an Officer To Be Named Later. The CO's seat is the center-most of the three, and features a comm-panel on the right arm with direct links to Main Engineering, Sickbay, Transporter Room 1, and Security.</p>
          <p>To the right of the CO's Chair is the XO's Chair, which does not have the comm-panel, but instead a workstation which can be used to display status reports on various systems. To the left of the CO's Chair is the Third Chair, which can be used by any officer, but most commonly the ship's Counselor, Second Officer, or a mission-specific officer. Like the XO's Chair, it lacks a comm-panel, but has a workstation.</p>
          <p>Behind the XO's Chair is the Security/Tactical console. This console is placed at a height to presume operation by a standing individual. If an assigned Security/Tactical officer is not tall enough, a barstool may be placed behind it. The Security/Tactical console allows the manning officer to monitor the ship's internal sensor network for intruders or unauthorized weapons fire, as well as control the ship's defensive shields, phasers, and torpedoes.</p>
          <p>Behind the CO's Chair is the Communications console. This console is also placed at a height to presume operation by a standing individual. If an assigned Communications officer is not tall enough, a barstool may be placed behind it. The Communications console allows the manning officer to monitor the ship's external communications feeds, and direct received messages to assigned destinations.</p>
          <p>Behind the Third Chair is the Operations console. This console is also placed at a height to presume operation by a standing individual. If an assigned Operations officer is not tall enough, a barstool may be placed behind it. The Operations console shares many functions with the workstation on the XO's Chair as far as displaying status reports of ship's systems. The Operations console also receives telemetry from sensor probes deployed by the ship.</p>
          <p>Behind the Operations console, along the port-side wall of the Bridge, are the Science workstations. Three mid-backed swivel-chairs are placed along the row of consoles, which can be used to begin various scans as well as receive the results and analyze them quickly for reports to the CO. If the results require deeper analysis, the Science workstations can quickly transfer the sensor data to a Science Lab.</p>
          <p>Behind the Communications console, along the aft wall of the Bridge, is the Engineering station, which features a copy of the Master Systems Display in Main Engineering, along with console inputs to allow an Engineer on the Bridge to quickly make adjustments ordered by the ship's Captain without requiring a call to Main Engineering.</p>
          <p>Behind the Security and Tactical console, along the starboard wall of the Bridge, are a set of workstations that can be adjusted to provide additional Science workstations, a larger Security station if intruders are detected, or a second Engineering station to monitor damage control teams. The workstations' setup mirrors that of the Science stations across the Bridge: a row of consoles and monitors with three mid-backed swivel-chairs placed along them at equally-spaced intervals.</p>
          <p>Between the spare workstations and the Engineering station are a door that leads to the Captain's Ready Room, as well as Turbolift 1. Between the Engineering station and the Science workstations are Turbolift 2, as well as a door that leads to the Main Briefing Room.</p>

          <p>Located adjacent to the Bridge on the starboard side of Deck 1 is the Captain's Ready Room, a hybrid office and spare room. The Ready Room is actually a suite, with the office area immediately inside the door leading to the Bridge, and behind that a small rest area.</p>
          <p>The office area features a desk with a computer workstation and comm panel, with one chair behind the desk and two in front of it, a replicator to the side nearest the aft bulkhead (from behind the desk facing the door, to the left) and a personal display area to the side nearest the forward bulkhead (from behind the desk facing the door, to the right). There is a potted plant just inside the door. The office area has one viewport looking out into space.</p>
          <p>Slightly offset from the office area is a personal rest area, with a cot and a small head to allow the Captain to freshen up without requiring a visit to his or her quarters. The cot is Marine-grade and not very comfortable, to discourage Captains from eschewing their quarters and living in their Ready Rooms.</p>
          <p>The personal rest area has five viewports looking out into space. These viewports can be tinted to up to 100 percent opacity by computer command to facilitate sleep.</p>

          <p>The ship's Auxiliary Bridge is located on Deck 7. It is the primary control center for the stardrive section when the ship is separated. It has three seats for the CO, XO, and someone else, a combined Conn/Ops station, a single Science station on the port-side wall, a single Engineering console along the aft wall, and a single Security station on the starboard-side wall. A Tactical/Communications station is placed behind the command chairs.</p>
          <p>The space in the Auxiliary Bridge is roughly one-third of that available on the Main Bridge, so as a consequence the number of available consoles is reduced and they (and thus, their manning officers) are placed closer together. The viewscreen in the Auxiliary Bridge is a 1.2m (measured diagonally) monitor placed on the forward bulkhead.</p>
          <p>Two turbolift shafts serve the Auxiliary Bridge, one between the Science station and the Engineering station, and one between the Engineering station and the Security station.</p>

          <p>The scientific facilities on a Manhattan-class vessel take up a large amount of space inside the saucer section. There are dedicated laboratory spaces on Decks 4-8, all of which are located far enough forward as to be fully contained within the saucer section. As noted above, each laboratory has a small, 1000-isolinear chip computer core for short-term information storage of research findings.</p>
          <p>In general, each lab has a basic layout that includes six computer terminals with access to the ship's sensor data; six lab stations for the conducting of experiments; an equipment storage cabinet with tricorders, scales, and various lab-specific equipment; a cold-storage unit where incomplete experiments can be placed into stasis to be resumed at a later time; and an emergency medical area including a first-aid medkit, chemical rinse and clean sink.</p>
          <p>On Deck 4 are storage and research facilities for plant life. Scientists studying the composition, growth patterns, reproductive habits, and life cycles of plants -- from bouquet flowers to alien species of crops -- in the fields including, but not limited to, Hydroponics, Botany, and Agronomy spend their time in the four laboratories on this deck. A modular area on this deck may be used by the Science Department for private growth of plants for research purposes, or opened up to the crew as a Botanical Garden.</p>
          <p>On Deck 5 are research facilities for animal life. Scientists studying and conducting research in fields including, but not limited to, Zoology and animal Anatomy and Physiology spend their time in the three laboratories on this deck. There are also two large holding areas for the research animals brought aboard: one where they are kept alive, and one where they are kept after death. At the discretion of the Science Department, a small modular area may be arranged for use as a small zoo, allowing the crew to observe and potentially interact with some of the more interesting (and less dangerous) of the animal species brought and kept aboard.</p>
          <p>On Deck 6 are research facilities for chemical elements and general physics. Scientists studying Chemistry (and all its various sub-disciplines) and Physics (but not Astrophysics, nor Astronomy) spend their time in the five laboratories on this deck, which also houses the General Sciences labs. The Chemistry lab has a secure chemical storage locker with biometric scanners to prevent unauthorized access of dangerous chemicals by non-scientists. The ship's three General Sciences labs are larger than the regular labs, but also easily subdivided. Instead of six computer terminals and six lab stations, each General Sciences lab has twelve terminals and twelve lab stations. Each lab station can be sectioned off for sensitive experiments by a forcefield upon computer command by a Science officer.</p>
          <p>The office of the ship's Chief Science Officer can be found on Deck 6, in between General Sciences Labs One and Two.</p>
          <p>On Deck 7 are research facilities for studying space and all its intricate, intriguing mysteries. Scientists studying Astrophysics, Astronomy, and Cosmology spend their time in the three laboratories on this deck, one of which is the ship's Stellar Cartography lab, which due to space requirements also extends to Deck 8. The room access and control station, however, is on Deck 7. There is no entrance or egress to the lab from Deck 8; that part of the room contains only holo-emitters and their support equipment.</p>
          <p>On Deck 8 are research facilities for studying planetary compositions. Scientists studying Geology, Hydrology, Volcanology, Meteorology spend their time in the three laboratories on this deck. Due to space requirements, part of the Stellar Cartography lab is located on this deck, but there is no access to that lab from this deck. </p>
          <p>Additional science facilities can be found in the stardrive section. Laboratory facilities for mechanical sciences can be found on Deck 17, adjacent to Main Engineering. These three labs include space for research in fields including Robotics and Cybernetics. These labs, like those in the saucer section, have the small, 1000-chip isolinear storage cores. They also have workbenches for assembling mechanical devices and new creations, as well as a replicator for the creation of materials and components. Scientists that work in these labs will often partner with Engineering staff in developing improvements to the ship's systems. </p>
          <p>Computer science researchers have lab space on Deck 13, in two rooms adjacent to the Main Computer. Unlike the other labs, these do not have individual 1000-chip isolinear cores for data storage. There are two lab stations, and computer terminals for crafting code and monitoring the status of the Main Computer. This lab also handles research into accessing computer equipment from other spacefaring powers, which is done without connections to the Main Computer, to prevent a hostile takeover of the ship's computer systems.</p>

        <p>The Manhattan-class has two shuttlebays, one in each section. Shuttlebay One is located aft on Deck 3, with additional airspace on Deck 2. It holds 2 Armadillo-class shuttlecraft and 1 Liberty-class runabout. There is a Flight Operations Control station in a transparent-aluminum-enclosed room directly adjacent to the Shuttlebay to control the comings and goings of auxiliary craft from the Shuttlebay. Atmosphere is secured by both a set of reinforced-duranium space doors and an atmospheric forcefield.</p>
        <p>Shuttlebay Two is located aft on Deck 20, with additional airspace on Deck 19. It holds either 2 Armadillo-class shuttlecraft or 1 Liberty-class runabout. In addition, all shuttlecraft and runabout repairs and maintenance work are done in this shuttlebay, due to its proximity to Main Engineering. Shuttlebay Two also has a small Flight Operations Control station in a transparent-aluminum-enclosed room directly adjacent to the Shuttlebay to control the comings and goings of auxiliary craft from the Shuttlebay. Atmosphere in Shuttlebay Two is likewise secured by both a set of reinforced-duranium space doors and an atmospheric forcefield.</p>
        <p>Neither Shuttlebay on board the Manhattan-class has facilities for storage, equipment, or maintenance of fightercraft.</p>
        <p>The Manhattan-class does not maintain a Captain's Yacht.</p>

        <p>Manhattan-class ships are named for persons and places involved with the 20th Century Manhattan Project, which developed the concept of splitting the atom, and began humanity's Nuclear Age. The Project created advancements in weapons and power generation, and spurred new developments in physics that led to the creation of Warp Drive a century later and continues to this day.</p>

        <p>AST Shipyards expects the Manhattan-class to continuously expand the boundaries of the Federation's knowledge of the galaxy for decades to come. Well-equipped and perfectly capable of defending itself, these large starships should be able to handle any exploration mission thrown their way.</p>
