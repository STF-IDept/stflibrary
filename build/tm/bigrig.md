Description {.title}
-----------

Faced with the growing demand on supplies created by the Crag and
Dominion Wars, Starfleet decided that a new standard freighter was
needed to maintain the supply backbone of the Federation. The first of
the new Monolith-class long range tugs went operational in early 2375,
and like many late 24th century starships was equipped with a Nyetscape
computer system.

Abraxis Shipworks, the construction company responsible for the
Monolith, had early on decided to go with a Nyetscape computer system
due to Nyetscape's long standing quality and high executive salaries.
They opted, however, to forgo an Artificial Intelligence system for cost
reasons, a limitation that Nyetscape accepted.

Nyetscape decided to design only a new Operating System for the
Monolith, and use the Starfleet-standard MAJEL interface, a decision
which shaved 3 months off of the design time. They also used a low-cost
K-66 core and DC-3 chipset, both provided by Nyetscape partner
Federation Micro Designs. The OS itself was designed specifically to
handle the requirements of a tug/freighter-class ship, specifically:

-   Handling all general ship operation input
-   Control and translation of helm and ops functions
-   transportation of raw and processed material and machinery
-   Invoice and PO tracking data storage and categorization

To this end, Nyetscape designed a system that consisted of two basic
structures; a ship-function division and a database management division.
The ship management division of the OS was written around the ship's
particular characteristics, and was not designed to be portable. There
was little revolutionary in the design, as such innovation would be
wasted on a tug. This portion of the OS formed the Basic Input/Output
Grunt, so called almost as a gag by the designers.

The database portion was more challenging. It's primary goal was filing,
data management, and categorization of the miriad of cargo into coherent
groups for easier access. Nyetscape engineers considered both relational
and object-oriented approaches to the system, before settling on a Solid
Information Descriptor system (SID). The SID was designed to catalogue
all the information entered into it and, following a strict, fleet-wide
regimen, classified the information into pre-defined groups. These
groups were then sub-filed using an object-oriented model, for greater
flexibility. The Regimented Information Grouper division of the OS was
written as a semi-independent module, so that it could potentially be
ported to other starships and platforms at a later date.

The Basic I/O Grunt, Regimented Information Grouper (BIGRIG) OS took
approximately 7 months to design, code, and test. The final product was
a rock solid, stable, if unimpressive from the user-end system, which
Abraxis readily accepted and built into the entire Monolith line. BIGRIG
did not dazzle the marketplace or the user, as previous offerings such
as GORBI and BORIS had, but served as the stable core for a stable and
successful starship line.
