History and Mission Overview {.title}
----------------------------

The 2380s saw Starfleet rededicate itself to its exploratory and
scientific research missions. Waves of new science-oriented ships were
commissioned and launched, at a rate almost reminiscent of
combat-oriented ships during the Dominion War. Most of these new science
ships were small, designed for exploration, finding new and interesting
things, and making notes of them. This left a gap in the market for
larger ships designed to follow up on the discoveries of the smaller
exploratory ships, and spend a long time studying them.

In 2383, engineers at AST Shipyards presented initial design concepts
for the Manhattan-class Heavy Researcher to a panel of senior officers
at Starfleet Engineering. The AST engineers recognized that Starfleet's
current dominant Researcher-type vessel, the Chimera-class, was a ship
class built on a modified (that is to say, gutted) Dreadnought platform.
The Manhattan-class, by contrast, would be designed from Day 1 with
scientific research in mind. The project was given prototype approval,
and the AST engineers returned home to begin final design and
construction.

The USS Manhattan, NCC-88000, debuted on Stardate 13073.0 to
satisfactory review. Starfleet placed an order with AST for an
additional nine ships of the class.

### Mission Profiles {.title}

Named for the early 20th Century Manhattan Project, the Manhattan-class
Heavy Researcher is designed for the following mission profiles:

-   Long-term study of newly-discovered systems
-   In-depth study of charted and uncharted planets
-   First contact with newly-discovered warp-capable species
-   Investigation of stellar and gravitic anomalies
-   Observation of star birth and death
-   General scientific research

Structure and Construction {.title}
--------------------------

he Manhattan-class is a large ship that generally conforms to Starfleet
design norms: it has a saucer section and a mostly-separate stardrive
section housing most Engineering systems, and is made with a hull of a
duranium/tritanium alloy. There are six decks that span both sections:
Decks 7-12.

The Manhattan-class' saucer section is a fully rounded dish, similar to
that of the Galaxy-class. It comprises the first twelve decks of the
ship (with parts of Decks 7-12, as mentioned above, continuing into the
stardrive section) and contains the bulk of the ship's scientific
equipment and personnel space. The saucer section is a full 350 meters
in diameter.

The stardrive section is a 150m wide, cigar-shaped body with 75m wide,
angled neck on top of it that connects the stardrive to the saucer. The
front of the stardrive on the lower four decks is cut at an angle to
house and protect the ship's deflector dish, while the rear of the
stardrive on the lower four decks is cut at an angle for aesthetic
reasons. The ship's nacelle pylons emerge from a point just aft of the
beginning of the neck on Deck 18. The pylons go out for 50m on each
side, then up another 20m where they join with the nacelles in airspace
near Deck 14. The stardrive section is 350 meters long, and has eighteen
decks, six of which are shared in part with the saucer, for a total deck
count of twenty-four decks.

The saucer section is connected by multiple hardpoints to the stardrive
on Decks 7-12. In an emergency, a Manhattan is capable of separating its
saucer section from the stardrive. Magnetic locks on the hardpoints are
disengaged by computer command once a hard seal has been established on
all access points between the two sections. As the separation occurs via
magnetic release and not explosive separation, the two sections can
reconnect once the emergency has passed.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems {.title}
----------------------------------

As a science ship, the designers put a great emphasis on the systems
installed on the Manhattan that would be used for science research and
experimentation. As such, it was given the highest-end equipment
available.

### Sensor Systems {.title}

The Manhattan-class is equipped with Type X sensors capable of seeing 5
light-years out from the ship on a high-resolution scan, and 17
light-years on low-resolution. The Manhattan-class sensor suite includes
the ability to perform multiphasic scans, as well as multiphase buffers
to enhance the sensors' information-gathering abilities. The ship's main
sensor pallets are located on Deck 2, with a secondary sensor array
located on Deck 18 for use by the stardrive section in the event of a
saucer separation.

### Computer Systems {.title}

The Manhattan-class requires a large amount of computing power to handle
its various scientific operations. The computer systems on board the
ship are some of the largest on any Starfleet vessel, regardless of
type. The Main Computer is made up of six isolinear-based cores
containing well over 100,000 isolinear chips in total, for a total of
nearly 50 million teraquads of data storage in the Main Computer alone.
The Manhattan's main computer is capable of sustaining 700 trillion
calculations per nanosecond. Each of the six Main Computer cores is
linked to the others by bio-neural circuitry to speed up processing
time. Manhattan-class ships carry additional bio-neural gel packs in
storage if needed. The Main Computer is located on Decks 13-15.

In addition to the main computer core, each science lab has a
1,000-isolinear-chip computer core to store pertinent experiment
information without taking space from the main computer. There are 21 of
these cores located throughout the ship, and each is linked to the
ship's Optical Data Network, allowing them to send information to other
labs or to the ship's main computer core if long-term storage is needed.

### Holo-Crew {.title}

The Manhattan-class does carry an Emergency Medical Hologram, whose
program may be activated in Sickbay, the Bridge, any Holodeck, or any
Science lab.

Warp Propulsion System {.title}
----------------------

To compensate for the heavy, high-end scientific loadout, reductions
were made in other systems across the ship, including the Warp Core.

The Manhattan is equipped with a mid-range Class-7 Warp Core producing
1,649+ Cochranes of energy. The Warp Core is located on Decks 16-20, in
Main Engineering. Its Matter/Antimatter Reactor Assembly is fueled by
deuterium stored in tanks on Deck 15 and anti-deuterium stored in
magnetically-contained tanks on Deck 21. There is no corridor access to
either fuel storage area. Security-coded doors in Main Engineering
provide controlled access for maintenance.

The Warp Core feeds drive plasma to the ship's two nacelles. The
Manhattan is capable of a cruising speed of Warp 6.0, a maximum
sustainable speed of Warp 9.0, and a maximum 12-hour speed of Warp 9.2.
In an extreme emergency, the Warp Core can speed the ship up to Warp
9.5, but this speed can only be sustained for approximately an hour
before major damage is done to the warp coils and the plasma injector
assemblies.

Manhattan-class ships are capable of ejecting their Warp Core. Upon the
command of the senior duty Engineer, the fuel linkages are sealed and
the Warp Core is fired by pneumatic pistons down a shaft to exit through
a ventral hatch, leaving the ship through the bottom of Deck 24.

Impulse Propulsion System {.title}
-------------------------

The Manhattan class has three impulse engines: two located in the saucer
section to enable it to maneuver while separated from the stardrive, and
one in the stardrive to provide impulse propulsion while separated from
the saucer. The two engines in the saucer are the primary impulse drives
for the ship when it is in one piece, but the third may also be
activated to provide extra thrust.

The two saucer section engines are located aft on Decks 5-6, one port
side and one starboard. They are each powered by two deuterium-fusion
reactors, with fuel tanks located on Deck 4. The stardrive engine is
located in the neck on Decks 13-15. It is also powered by two
deuterium-fusion reactors, which take their fuel from the same deuterium
tanks on Deck 15 which feed the Warp Core.

When solely powered by the two saucer engines, the Manhattan can achieve
a speed of .2c. When all three engines are active, the maximum speed
increases to .25c. It takes the ship 45 seconds to achieve this maximum
speed from a dead stop, and 70 seconds to go from .25c to a dead stop.

Tactical Systems {.title}
----------------

### Shields {.title}

The Manhattan-class is equipped with a Type-9 shielding system capable
of bearing a Max Graviton Load of 1,881 megawatts and boasting a Max
Dissipation Rate of 5.11 x 10\^5 kilowatts. This shielding system is
supplemented by a Metaphasic Shield Generator to protect the ship and
crew from heavy radiation emitted by stellar bodies it may be studying.
The emitters for the Type-9 Defensive Shields are located at key points
across the ship's hull. The Metaphasic Shield is generated by the Main
Deflector, located on Decks 21-24.

### Phasers {.title}

Manhattan-class ships are lightly armed, since as science vessels in
general they are not expected to see combat, and as Researchers in
particular are not expected to be sent somewhere combat is expected to
break out. As such, they are equipped with eight Type-VI phaser arrays,
located thusly:

-   1x Deck 2, forward of the ship's name and registry number
-   1x Deck 2, aft of the Bridge
-   1x Deck 2, starboard
-   1x Deck 2, port
-   1x Deck 7, aft
-   1x Deck 11, forward edge of the saucer section
-   1x Deck 19, along the dorsal surface of the stardrive section
-   1x Deck 24, along the ventral surface of the stardrive section

Each phaser array is comprised of 150 emitters, and can fire a 0.6
megawatt beam to an effective distance of 35,000 kilometers.

### Torpedo Systems {.title}

The designers of the Manhattan-class opted for a balanced approach to
selecting torpedo/probe launching systems for the ship. While the new
design standards allowed them to have six standard torpedo/probe
launchers or two of the larger multi-load/fire launchers, they opted to
use three standard launchers and one "burst fire" launcher.

The three standard launchers are located on Decks 18 and 19. One (on
Deck 18) faces aft, while the other two (on Deck 19) face forward. The
burst fire launcher is located on Deck 12, in a hull bubble on the
underside of the saucer section.

Since the launchers are so spread out from each other, the
Manhattan-class has two storage bays for photon torpedoes and probes.
Torpedo Bay 1 is located on Deck 11 and holds 100 torpedo casings. 50
are designated for photon torpedoes, 25 are pre-assembled standard
probes, and the remaining 25 are customizable probes used as needed by
the Science Department.

Torpedo Bay 2 is located on Deck 18 and feeds all three of the standard
single-shot launchers. It holds the ship's remaining 100 torpedo
casings. Like Torpedo Bay 1, 50 casings are designated for use as photon
torpedoes, 25 are pre-assembled standard probes, and the remaining 25
are customizable probes used as needed by the Science Department.

As a Science vessel, the Manhattan-class does not carry quantum
torpedoes.

Command and Support Systems {.title}
---------------------------

### Bridge {.title}

The Manhattan-class Bridge, like most Federation starships, is located
on Deck 1. Unlike some modern starships with a holographic viewscreen
projected onto the forward wall, the Manhattan-class uses the
tried-and-true physical viewscreen mounted on the forward wall. The
viewscreen is 4 meters tall and 3 meters wide, and is capable of
displaying as many as 16 different feeds simultaneously.

Forward of the viewscreen is the Conn console, with a mid-backed swivel
seat for the manning officer. The Conn console is responsible for
piloting the ship, handling both helm control and navigation. The Conn
officer is responsible for inputting the desired values for the ship's
pitch, yaw, roll and speed manually, or selecting from a pre-programmed
menu of maneuvers.

Behind the viewscreen, mounted at the top of a gently-sloped ramp area,
is the Command platform, with seating for the ship's Commanding Officer,
Executive Officer, and an Officer To Be Named Later. The CO's seat is
the center-most of the three, and features a comm-panel on the right arm
with direct links to Main Engineering, Sickbay, Transporter Room 1, and
Security.

To the right of the CO's Chair is the XO's Chair, which does not have
the comm-panel, but instead a workstation which can be used to display
status reports on various systems. To the left of the CO's Chair is the
Third Chair, which can be used by any officer, but most commonly the
ship's Counselor, Second Officer, or a mission-specific officer. Like
the XO's Chair, it lacks a comm-panel, but has a workstation.

Behind the XO's Chair is the Security/Tactical console. This console is
placed at a height to presume operation by a standing individual. If an
assigned Security/Tactical officer is not tall enough, a barstool may be
placed behind it. The Security/Tactical console allows the manning
officer to monitor the ship's internal sensor network for intruders or
unauthorized weapons fire, as well as control the ship's defensive
shields, phasers, and torpedoes.

Behind the CO's Chair is the Communications console. This console is
also placed at a height to presume operation by a standing individual.
If an assigned Communications officer is not tall enough, a barstool may
be placed behind it. The Communications console allows the manning
officer to monitor the ship's external communications feeds, and direct
received messages to assigned destinations.

Behind the Third Chair is the Operations console. This console is also
placed at a height to presume operation by a standing individual. If an
assigned Operations officer is not tall enough, a barstool may be placed
behind it. The Operations console shares many functions with the
workstation on the XO's Chair as far as displaying status reports of
ship's systems. The Operations console also receives telemetry from
sensor probes deployed by the ship.

Behind the Operations console, along the port-side wall of the Bridge,
are the Science workstations. Three mid-backed swivel-chairs are placed
along the row of consoles, which can be used to begin various scans as
well as receive the results and analyze them quickly for reports to the
CO. If the results require deeper analysis, the Science workstations can
quickly transfer the sensor data to a Science Lab.

Behind the Communications console, along the aft wall of the Bridge, is
the Engineering station, which features a copy of the Master Systems
Display in Main Engineering, along with console inputs to allow an
Engineer on the Bridge to quickly make adjustments ordered by the ship's
Captain without requiring a call to Main Engineering.

Behind the Security and Tactical console, along the starboard wall of
the Bridge, are a set of workstations that can be adjusted to provide
additional Science workstations, a larger Security station if intruders
are detected, or a second Engineering station to monitor damage control
teams. The workstations' setup mirrors that of the Science stations
across the Bridge: a row of consoles and monitors with three mid-backed
swivel-chairs placed along them at equally-spaced intervals.

Between the spare workstations and the Engineering station are a door
that leads to the Captain's Ready Room, as well as Turbolift 1. Between
the Engineering station and the Science workstations are Turbolift 2, as
well as a door that leads to the Main Briefing Room.

### Captain's Ready Room {.title}

Located adjacent to the Bridge on the starboard side of Deck 1 is the
Captain's Ready Room, a hybrid office and spare room. The Ready Room is
actually a suite, with the office area immediately inside the door
leading to the Bridge, and behind that a small rest area.

The office area features a desk with a computer workstation and comm
panel, with one chair behind the desk and two in front of it, a
replicator to the side nearest the aft bulkhead (from behind the desk
facing the door, to the left) and a personal display area to the side
nearest the forward bulkhead (from behind the desk facing the door, to
the right). There is a potted plant just inside the door. The office
area has one viewport looking out into space.

Slightly offset from the office area is a personal rest area, with a cot
and a small head to allow the Captain to freshen up without requiring a
visit to his or her quarters. The cot is Marine-grade and not very
comfortable, to discourage Captains from eschewing their quarters and
living in their Ready Rooms.

The personal rest area has five viewports looking out into space. These
viewports can be tinted to up to 100 percent opacity by computer command
to facilitate sleep.

### Main Briefing Room {.title}

The ship's Main Briefing Room is located adjacent to the Bridge on the
port side of Deck 1. It is comprised of a long table with seats and
computer access for eight, a large monitor on the bulkhead shared with
the Bridge, a replicator and small buffet table along the aft wall, and
three potted plants: two along the front wall, and one on the aft side
of the door.

The Main Briefing Room has six viewports looking out into space.

### Auxiliary Bridge {.title}

The ship's Auxiliary Bridge is located on Deck 7. It is the primary
control center for the stardrive section when the ship is separated. It
has three seats for the CO, XO, and someone else, a combined Conn/Ops
station, a single Science station on the port-side wall, a single
Engineering console along the aft wall, and a single Security station on
the starboard-side wall. A Tactical/Communications station is placed
behind the command chairs.

The space in the Auxiliary Bridge is roughly one-third of that available
on the Main Bridge, so as a consequence the number of available consoles
is reduced and they (and thus, their manning officers) are placed closer
together. The viewscreen in the Auxiliary Bridge is a 1.2m (measured
diagonally) monitor placed on the forward bulkhead.

Two turbolift shafts serve the Auxiliary Bridge, one between the Science
station and the Engineering station, and one between the Engineering
station and the Security station.

### Auxiliary Briefing Room {.title}

The ship's Auxiliary Briefing Room is located adjacent to the Auxiliary
Bridge on Deck 7, port side. It contains a long table with seats for
eight, one computer access station at the head of the table, a
replicator and a monitor on the bulkhead shared with the Bridge. There
are three viewports and no potted plants.

### Main Engineering {.title}

Main Engineering is located on Decks 16-20, around the ship's warp core.
It is a large, circular room, with no ceilings between these decks in
this section. There are walkways around the warp core, connected by
ladders. Each level's walkway has stations scattered about it to monitor
the status of various systems on the ship and with the warp core itself.

The office of the ship's Chief Engineer is located on Deck 18, along
with the ship's Master Systems Display. There are spare parts storage
facilities located on Decks 16 and 20, and Jefferies' Tube Access on
Decks 17 and 19.

### Science Laboratories {.title}

The scientific facilities on a Manhattan-class vessel take up a large
amount of space inside the saucer section. There are dedicated
laboratory spaces on Decks 4-8, all of which are located far enough
forward as to be fully contained within the saucer section. As noted
above, each laboratory has a small, 1000-isolinear chip computer core
for short-term information storage of research findings.

In general, each lab has a basic layout that includes six computer
terminals with access to the ship's sensor data; six lab stations for
the conducting of experiments; an equipment storage cabinet with
tricorders, scales, and various lab-specific equipment; a cold-storage
unit where incomplete experiments can be placed into stasis to be
resumed at a later time; and an emergency medical area including a
first-aid medkit, chemical rinse and clean sink.

On Deck 4 are storage and research facilities for plant life. Scientists
studying the composition, growth patterns, reproductive habits, and life
cycles of plants -- from bouquet flowers to alien species of crops -- in
the fields including, but not limited to, Hydroponics, Botany, and
Agronomy spend their time in the four laboratories on this deck. A
modular area on this deck may be used by the Science Department for
private growth of plants for research purposes, or opened up to the crew
as a Botanical Garden.

On Deck 5 are research facilities for animal life. Scientists studying
and conducting research in fields including, but not limited to, Zoology
and animal Anatomy and Physiology spend their time in the three
laboratories on this deck. There are also two large holding areas for
the research animals brought aboard: one where they are kept alive, and
one where they are kept after death. At the discretion of the Science
Department, a small modular area may be arranged for use as a small zoo,
allowing the crew to observe and potentially interact with some of the
more interesting (and less dangerous) of the animal species brought and
kept aboard.

On Deck 6 are research facilities for chemical elements and general
physics. Scientists studying Chemistry (and all its various
sub-disciplines) and Physics (but not Astrophysics, nor Astronomy) spend
their time in the five laboratories on this deck, which also houses the
General Sciences labs. The Chemistry lab has a secure chemical storage
locker with biometric scanners to prevent unauthorized access of
dangerous chemicals by non-scientists. The ship's three General Sciences
labs are larger than the regular labs, but also easily subdivided.
Instead of six computer terminals and six lab stations, each General
Sciences lab has twelve terminals and twelve lab stations. Each lab
station can be sectioned off for sensitive experiments by a forcefield
upon computer command by a Science officer.

The office of the ship's Chief Science Officer can be found on Deck 6,
in between General Sciences Labs One and Two.

On Deck 7 are research facilities for studying space and all its
intricate, intriguing mysteries. Scientists studying Astrophysics,
Astronomy, and Cosmology spend their time in the three laboratories on
this deck, one of which is the ship's Stellar Cartography lab, which due
to space requirements also extends to Deck 8. The room access and
control station, however, is on Deck 7. There is no entrance or egress
to the lab from Deck 8; that part of the room contains only
holo-emitters and their support equipment.

On Deck 8 are research facilities for studying planetary compositions.
Scientists studying Geology, Hydrology, Volcanology, Meteorology spend
their time in the three laboratories on this deck. Due to space
requirements, part of the Stellar Cartography lab is located on this
deck, but there is no access to that lab from this deck.

Additional science facilities can be found in the stardrive section.
Laboratory facilities for mechanical sciences can be found on Deck 17,
adjacent to Main Engineering. These three labs include space for
research in fields including Robotics and Cybernetics. These labs, like
those in the saucer section, have the small, 1000-chip isolinear storage
cores. They also have workbenches for assembling mechanical devices and
new creations, as well as a replicator for the creation of materials and
components. Scientists that work in these labs will often partner with
Engineering staff in developing improvements to the ship's systems.

Computer science researchers have lab space on Deck 13, in two rooms
adjacent to the Main Computer. Unlike the other labs, these do not have
individual 1000-chip isolinear cores for data storage. There are two lab
stations, and computer terminals for crafting code and monitoring the
status of the Main Computer. This lab also handles research into
accessing computer equipment from other spacefaring powers, which is
done without connections to the Main Computer, to prevent a hostile
takeover of the ship's computer systems.

Utility Systems {.title}

### Cargo Bays {.title}

Manhattan-class vessels have four cargo bays, all located on Decks 9-10.
Cargo Bays 1 and 2 are located adjacent to each other on the outer edge
of the starboard side of the saucer section, while Cargo Bays 3 and 4
are located adjacent to each other on the outer edge of the port side of
the saucer section. Bays 1 and 3 are generally filled with supplies for
the ship's general day-to-day operations, while 2 and 4 are left mostly
empty to be filled with items collected during the missions, while also
storing mission-specific cargo.

Each cargo bay is equipped with a cargo transporter, as well as a
grappling system for crew members to reach cargo stored on the upper
levels of the bay. In an emergency, the cargo bays can be converted to
triage centers or refugee camps.

### Tractor Beam {.title}

The tractor beam is a standard piece of equipment on board the
Manhattan, with the paired 16 MW Graviton Polarity Sources producing 32
Megawatts of Gravity Displacing Power, effective up to a range of up to
20,000 kilometers. The tractor beam emitter is located on Deck 17.

### Transporter Systems {.title}

The Manhattan-class has three pairs of transporter rooms. Transporter
Rooms 1 and 2 are located on Deck 3, with a pattern buffer located
directly beneath them on Deck 4. Transporter Rooms 3 and 4 are located
on Deck 15, with a pattern buffer located directly beneath them on Deck
16. Transporter Rooms 5 and 6 are located on Deck 22, with a pattern
buffer located directly beneath them on Deck 23. These six transporter
rooms each have six transporter pads and can complete one transporter
cycle every sixty seconds.

There are an additional two Emergency Transporter rooms to be used for
evacuations only. One is located on Deck 11, in the saucer section, with
the pattern buffer directly below it on Deck 12, saucer section. The
other is located on Deck 21, with a pattern buffer directly below it on
Deck 22. These transporter rooms each have twelve transporter pads and
can complete one transporter cycle every thirty seconds.

Transporter Rooms 1-6 have a transporter console that is constantly
manned by a transporter operator, while each Emergency Transporter Room
has a transporter console that is only staffed after the ship goes to
Yellow Alert. Additionally, all of the transporters can be controlled
from the Operations console on the Bridge or the Engineering console on
the Auxiliary Bridge.

### Turbolifts {.title}

A Manhattan-class ship has two main turbolift tubes which run throughout
the ship, and two additional turbolift tubes which only serve either the
saucer or the stardrive sections. Turbolift cars are deployed out of a
repair and staging area on Deck 12, with holding niches located every
few decks to allow critical or emergency calls to be routed quickly over
standard calls.

Crew Support Systems {.title}
--------------------

### Sickbay {.title}

Sickbay is a critical area of the ship, and is divided into several
areas, each with a specific purpose. The first area is the General
Purpose Ward, where crewmen needing physicals or treatment for abrasions
and minor broken bones go. There are two standard biobeds in this Ward.

The second area is the Surgical Ward, where crewmen with serious
injuries that require surgery go. This Ward is equipped with three
surgical biobeds.

The third is the Recovery Ward, where crewmen who survive the Surgical
Ward go to recuperate. This Ward has six standard biobeds, each of which
can be screened off to provide extra patient privacy upon request.

The fourth is the Administrative Ward, where the office of the CMO and
his subordinate officers are located, and also where people who can't be
seen immediately are diverted. The waiting area of this ward has eight
uncomfortable chairs, a coffee table, and a potted plant in each corner.

The fifth is the Morgue, where bodies of deceased crew are stored until
autopsies can be performed. Those autopsies are performed in the sixth
area, the Medical lab, which is also used for medical research-such as
new medicines and cures. The Medlab and the Morgue are located adjacent
to each other. Diagnostic medical staff work in the Medlab to run tests
that cannot be performed with tricorders or on biobeds.

Sickbay is located on Deck 3, forward of the Transporter Rooms.

### Replicators {.title}

All crew quarters, as well as the ship's lounge, briefing rooms, crew
and officer's mess, Captain's Ready Room, and Department Head offices
have a replicator. The replicator is capable of producing all manner of
items, from foodstuffs to clothing. A Manhattan-class ship is equipped
with enough replicator stock for 30 months' standard use.

### Crew Quarters {.title}

Crew quarters on the Manhattan are located on Decks 4 through 12, mostly
in the saucer section. The Captain and XO have cabins on Deck 2.
Quarters on Deck 4 are reserved for Department Heads and VIPs. Quarters
on Deck 5-12 are reserved for Junior Officers and Enlisted Crew.

JO/Enlisted quarters have a reception area, a bedroom, a small head, and
a replicator. The reception area consists of a desk with a computer
access terminal and two chairs. Senior Officer quarters have a living
room, a bedroom, a bathroom, and a replicator. The living room contains
a desk with a computer access terminal, and three chairs. Captain, XO,
and VIP quarters have a living room, a bedroom, a bathroom, a
kitchenette and a replicator.

VIP quarters can be adjusted to Class-H, -K, or -L atmospheric
conditions. Outside of quarters, dignitaries from those atmospheres are
required to wear environment suits.

### Holographic Recreation {.title}

There are three full-sized holodecks located aboard a Manhattan-class
vessel. Holodeck 1 is located on Deck 8, Holodeck 2 is located on Deck
20, and Holodeck 3 is located on Deck 23. There are also two holosuites
on the ship, both located on Deck 10, beneath the Crew Mess.

### Lounge {.title}

The Ship's Lounge on the Manhattan-class is located forward on Deck 8,
in the saucer section. It has seating (at the bar and at tables) for 140
people. The lounge is equipped with both a replicator and a staffed
kitchen, as well as a manned bar. There is a stage area which can be
used for performances or ceremonies.

### Crew Mess {.title}

The Crew Mess is located on Deck 9, in the saucer section. It has
seating for 130 people, and is equipped with a replicator. The Crew Mess
does not have a staffed kitchen. There are six viewports looking forward
from the Crew Mess.

### Officer's Mess {.title}

The Officer's Mess is located on Deck 3. It is a small room, with five
viewports looking forward and seating for up to 20 people. It has both a
replicator and a staffed kitchen. It can be used for every day dining by
Department Heads and other senior officers, or for formal dinners when
the ship is hosting dignitaries.

### Counselor's Office {.title}

The office of the ship's Counselor is located on Deck 8. The office has
a desk with a computer access terminal and comfortable chair for the
CNS, as well as a standard counseling couch and a regular comfortable
chair for crew seeking the CNS' services.

Auxiliary Spacecraft Systems {.title}
----------------------------

The Manhattan-class has two shuttlebays, one in each section. Shuttlebay
One is located aft on Deck 3, with additional airspace on Deck 2. It
holds 2 Armadillo-class shuttlecraft and 1 Liberty-class runabout. There
is a Flight Operations Control station in a
transparent-aluminum-enclosed room directly adjacent to the Shuttlebay
to control the comings and goings of auxiliary craft from the
Shuttlebay. Atmosphere is secured by both a set of reinforced-duranium
space doors and an atmospheric forcefield.

Shuttlebay Two is located aft on Deck 20, with additional airspace on
Deck 19. It holds either 2 Armadillo-class shuttlecraft or 1
Liberty-class runabout. In addition, all shuttlecraft and runabout
repairs and maintenance work are done in this shuttlebay, due to its
proximity to Main Engineering. Shuttlebay Two also has a small Flight
Operations Control station in a transparent-aluminum-enclosed room
directly adjacent to the Shuttlebay to control the comings and goings of
auxiliary craft from the Shuttlebay. Atmosphere in Shuttlebay Two is
likewise secured by both a set of reinforced-duranium space doors and an
atmospheric forcefield.

Neither Shuttlebay on board the Manhattan-class has facilities for
storage, equipment, or maintenance of fightercraft.

The Manhattan-class does not maintain a Captain's Yacht.

Ships of the Class {.title}
------------------

Manhattan-class ships are named for persons and places involved with the
20th Century Manhattan Project, which developed the concept of splitting
the atom, and began humanity's Nuclear Age. The Project created
advancements in weapons and power generation, and spurred new
developments in physics that led to the creation of Warp Drive a century
later and continues to this day.
