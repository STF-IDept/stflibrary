History and Mission Overview {.title}
----------------------------

The Armadillo shuttlecraft was developed at Avalon Ship Yards for two
reasons.

Firstly, the development of the Pendragon-Class vessels. It was felt
that a new shuttlecraft, more suited for the needs of combat vessels,
was required.

Secondly, the massive crew reassignments both during and in the
aftermath of the Dominion War. With many ships in the field, warp
capable shuttle was deemed more suitable for transferring low numbers of
crew member.

The Armadillo, named for a species of mammal native to Earth, was
designed to fit these needs. It's primary purpose is as a transport for
crew members, both for crew transfers and away teams. It also serves to
increase the science capabilities of vessels, especially combat vessels,
by effective extending sensor range and providing alternative means by
which to examine anomalies. In some situations, it can also be used to
transport ground forces to a planet, and subsequently provide air
support for said forces, although it isn't ideal for such a role.

Structure and Construction {.title}
--------------------------

The Armadillo has a narrow nose, widening as it approaches the
mid-section, at which point it settles down to one width. The overall
shape is a curved upper surface, starting at the nose, with
comparatively flat underside and a flat rear hull surface. Warp nacelles
are attached to the craft's sides towards the rear of the shuttle.

The shuttle is constructed from standard Tritanium and Duranium alloys.
The main space frame is constructed in a single piece, intended to
reduce the power required for Structural Integrity Fields.

Overall, the Armadillo measures 3.24m in height, 9.43m in length, and
has a beam measurement of 5.72m.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems {.title}
----------------------------------

The Armadillo's computer core isolinear rods. User interface is provided
by LCARS. Off-the-shelf sensor packages are used on the Armadillo.

Warp Propulsion Systems {.title}
-----------------------

The Armadillo is equipped with a 28 Cochrane Warp core. This allows for
a sustainable cruise of Warp Factor 1.4. Maximum Warp is warp factor 2.3
for 3 hours.

Impulse Propulsion Systems {.title}
--------------------------

Sub-light propulsion is provided by RCS packages designed to provide
adequate sub-light speed. These provide a sustainable speed of 0.23c.
Although not the fastest craft around, it's manoeuvring ability is
exceeded only by fighter craft.

Tactical Systems {.title}
----------------

Given the general wartime conditions during development, it would have
been foolish not to give the Armadillo some tactical systems. It is
important to note that, although present, weaponry on the Armadillo does
little more than comfort the crew against anything larger than another
shuttle.

The Armadillo was given Shield Generators providing a Maximum
Gravitational Load of 27 MW, with a Maximum Energy Dissipation rate of
790 kW.

Offensive systems consist of two Type-IV phaser as standard, upgradeable
to Type-V if needed.

Utility Systems {.title}
---------------

The Armadillo is equipped with a single Transporter Pad, which can
transport two people up to 5000 kilometers.

Crew Support Systems {.title}
--------------------

Although extensive crew support facilities are impossible on a
shuttlecraft, some are included. A single replicator is found within the
craft, limited to a single beverage or small dish at a time, along with
two emergency med-kits, should the need to use them arise. Survival
rations are stored next to the replicator, should the latter be
inoperable.

Conclusion {.title}
----------

Following the development of the Armadillo as an armoured shuttlecraft,
the design has been used extensively by Avalon and other Ship Yards, due
to its versatile and resistant design. It continues to see service in a
variety of situations.
