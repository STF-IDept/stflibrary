        <p>As the Dominion war began to heat up, Star Fleet strategists realized that the general combat modified Valhalla class runabouts, were of little military value when used to make tactical strikes upon larger combat vessels. It was decided that what Star Fleet needed was a small, easy to mass produce combat vessel capable of warp speeds, and armed with sufficient weaponry to become a distracting threat to enemy task force operations until reinforcements could arrive. The mission profile upon the beginning of the design process is still adhered today is as follows: </p>

        <p>The Ranger's space frame consists of a duranium/tritanium plasma tempered alloy. The hull is a sandwich of layers. Each layer is 2cm thick, consisting of duranium, tritanium, and plexiprine. On top of that is a .5cm layer of ablative armor. This multi layering has a dual purpose. It adds strength to the overall spacecraft structure, while allowing the spacecraft to absorb energy more efficiently. In addition, the Ranger's nose and leading edges have a total of .75cm of ablative armor for added protection during head on attacks.  The canopy is standard transparent aluminum with a thickness of 4cm.  In general appearance: The Ranger has a main fuselage that houses 80% of it's operating systems. Including the impulse drive, power units, warp core, and sensory systems. Jutting forward is a smooth, elongated nose which houses a crew cockpit. In an emergency the cockpit can be jettisoned from the main section and act as a life boat for the crew. Four, broad, deep delta wings are located on either side of the main section in pairs, each pair with a weapons or other mission specific hard point on the outer tip of the wing. A dorsal blister houses the type-5 phaser array. Upon the aft section of the main fuselage is the variable geometry plasma exhaust vent for the dual impulse drives. Crew access into the Ranger is through a hatch located on the port aft section of the cockpit which lowers down from the fuselage, and is equipped with "steps" for easy access. There is also an emergency hatch located above and slightly aft of the cockpit.  </p>

        <p>The Ranger is equipped with a sensory suite that enables it to scan regions of space in a 4.5 light year radius in high resolution, and 17 light years in low resolution. There is also an ECM (electronic counter measures) suite installed on the Ranger. This suite is capable of producing sensory ghosts, and confusing enemy targeting systems by either jamming, or overlapping an enemies sensory frequencies with altered information for a distance up to and including 1000km. Although it is at a reduced efficiency at such distances. The ECM suite is most efficient when activated at distances of 500km or less. The Ranger also houses a small subspace decoy launcher which contains 8 decoys. These decoys generate a strong short ranged subspace distortion field capable of distracting the acquisition scanners of most known types of guided munitions. Effective range of the subspace decoy is 100km.  </p>

          <p>For use in extended range reconnaissance, the Ranger can exchange it's wing tip munitions for a sophisticated sensory pod. Total time for the weapons/sensory pod exchange is approximately 3 hours because of the sophistication of the systems involved. Equipped in such a way, the Ranger's high resolution range is increased to a radius of 6 light years, with an 18 light year range at low resolution. The additional sensory/computer pods also allow the revamped Ranger to effectively jam or confuse approximately 95% of all known targeting systems to a radius of 10,000 km. This diminishes towards 75% at 15,000km, and 50% at a radius of 20,000km. Even so, this makes the Reconnaissance Ranger a potent asset to a combined fighter/fighter bomber attack by providing long range targeting acquisition and tactical information. And an ECM field in which the attacking squadron can deploy with an adequate anti targeting sensor envelope. </p>

          <p>A multi grafted isolinear core, housing over 130 separate isolinear chips. The entire computer core is shielded against radiation with a 1cm layer of tetraburnium sandwiched between two 5mm layers of duranium. For ease of maintenance, the Main Computer Core is of a single module that can be disconnected and replaced with a spare in seconds. This design trades off the ability of being repaired in-flight for that of rugged dependability. </p>

        <p>The Ranger is a powered by a warp core rated at 500 conchranes. The core is mounted lengthwise along the centerline within the lower section of the main fuselage. The warp drive is capable of giving the Ranger a Cruising velocity of Warp 5.5 for 72 hours, with a Maximum Sustainable Velocity of Warp 6.0, and a Maximum Velocity of Warp 6.5 for 12 hours. The warp drive is also equipped to produce a micro warp field to decrease the effects of relativistic distortions during high sub light speeds. It had been debated on whether to mount bussard scoops along the Ranger's leading and trailing edges of it's wing. But the space and structural requirements forced the omission from the final design. In point of fact: The bussard vents would have added so much mass and volume to the Ranger as to reduce its over all military capability.</p>

        <p>The Ranger is equipped with dual impulse engines for sub light propulsion. This unique "twin engine" design allows the Ranger to operate at an increased range, and better thrust to rate ratios, at a slightly lower cost in fuel then using a standard, larger impulse unit. It also has the added advantage of allowing the Ranger to maneuver even if one impulse engine has been damaged. The dual impulse engines are housed within a 3cm thick tritanium "box", and are separated by a 4cm thick bulkhead within the box to prevent one damaged drive from affecting the other. The thrust generated from each impulse engine is funneled into its own variable geometry exhaust vent. Each vent has a maximum deflection of 15 degrees from the centerline, both vertical and horizontal to help decrease the Ranger's turning radius (vectored thrust). For ease of maintenance, the entire vent assembly can be detached in order to slide the impulse drives from their armored box. The engines can be replaced and the vent re-attached in 15 minutes by a skilled ground crew. Each impulse engine is capable of powering the Ranger to 0.20c for 16.5 hours. Together, the dual impulse drives can propel the Ranger to speeds of 0.28c for 25 hours. For an extra boost of speed in emergency circumstances, the Ranger can utilize it's warp drive to create a micro warp envelope, allowing the Ranger to operate at 0.35c for 1 hour.</p>

          <p>4 Mark-7 shield deflectors. Each capable of generating a 350 miliconchrane subspace distortion field and are powered by two 24 MW fusion reactors. Combined, the deflectors are capable of a graviton load displacement up to 240.0 MW, with a maximum energy dissipation rate in excess of 3.65 x 10^3 KW. </p>

          <p>4 type-5 tetryon pulse cannons mounted in the nose to fire forward only. Each tetryon cannon produces a 45% greater energy yield then standard phasers of the same size. Within the discharge chamber of the cannon, there is located a phased ionic pulse emitter, a metaphasic field generator, and a subspace transducer coil. When a phased ionic pulse comes into contact with the metaphasic field, it creates a mass of tetryon particles. The subspace transducer coil then envelops the tetryon particles with a subspace containment field. Once the field has been condensed to a predetermined size (depending on the desired energy yield), the subspace coil then polarizes the field and accelerates it out towards the target. Tetryons by definition are only stable within the confines of subspace, and are highly unstable in normal space. Thus, once the subspace/tetryon charge interacts with an object occupying normal space, the subspace field desolves and the entire kinetic energy stored within the compressed tetryonic charge is released. Each cannon has a recharge rate of 0.25 seconds, and can have a sustained maximum firing rate of 240 pulses per minute for 5 minutes. Effective range is 15,000km with a maximum pulse energy of 0.27 MW. Firing arc is forward only.  </p>
          <p>Two wing tip mounted weapons pods. Each capable of carrying either 30 minitorps, OR one Mark-IV photon torpedo. Maximum range of the minitorp launcher is 175,000km. Maximum range for the Mark IV photorp is 350,000km. Both sets of munitions are guided.</p>
          <p>One standard Type-5 phaser emitter in a dorsal blister mount located in the above aft section of the main fuselage.  Continuos beam energy output is 0.18 MW for a duration of 10 minutes.  Maximum range is 9,000km. The Firing arch is 360 degrees with up to 90 degrees of elevation.</p>

          <p>The Ranger has a triple set of controls. One for each member of the crew.  Although each set of controls are configured for a specific purpose, they are able to access every function onboard the Ranger. In addition, the Pilot's main flight controls are a manual joystick and lever mounted on the armrests of the flight seat. The left joystick controls pitch, roll, and yaw, and the firing of the Tetryon Cannons. While the right lever controls the throttle for both warp and impulse, activation of the micro warp field, and retractable speed brakes (mounted in 4 main panels along the upper and lower fuselage for decreasing velocity while in a planet's atmosphere). The Weapon's Officer's controls handle the ship to ship communication, sensory scans, all weapons targeting systems, and navigation. While the Flight Engineer's controls manage propulsion, life support, and other subsystems. It was decided that a three man crew would reduce the work load of the crewmembers while maintaining a peek level of proficiency.</p>

          <p>Although the Ranger has a standard cockpit life support system, it isrecommended that the crew wear and EVA flight suit during combat maneuvers. Also, the entire crew compartment can be separated from the Ranger and used as a life pod. As a life pod, the crew compartment is equipped with small maneuvering thrusters to aid in the separation and maneuvering away from the Ranger. It is shaped and material designed to be able to re-entered a Class M planet's atmosphere safely. Emergency life support is good for 72 hours for a crew of 3. The crew compartment is equipped with three seats, and a rear storage locker equipped with a food replicater and a full complement of emergency survival gear for 3 crewmen up to 3 days. This includes three flight suits, a small life support pod, emergency food and water rations, three type-2 hand phasers, three solar blankets, a first aid kit, a portable fusion generator, 4 bio-chemical lamps, and a portable emergency subspace transmitter. The small life support pod can be attached to a crewman's flight suit while in EVA to extend the duration of the suit's life support for a maximum of three days per crewman. Each flight suit is equipped with a nutritional IV packet. Upon activation by the crewman, the packet releases a predetermined dosage of nutrients within a specified time  interval.</p>
          <p>Also included for each crewmember is a miniature survival kit complete with one combination Cardasian phrase book and Bible, one hundred slips of latinum, nine packs of Double Juicy Fruit Gum, one issue box of 12 prophylactics, three lipsticks, three pairs of nylon stockings, and a 1kg bar of chocolate.</p>

        <p>Recently, several Ranger bomber crews have taken to the age old tradition of "Nose Art". Giving their craft comical names and painting rather intricate characters or cartoons upon the nose.  Although such practice is usually frowned upon, there is no definitive regulation against the practice. Examples of such endowments include:</p>
