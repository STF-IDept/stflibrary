        <p>Starfleet has made use of fighter craft for more than three hundred years, long before it's inception as the defensive and exploratory arm of the Federation, largely in a role as planetary defenders and small scale combat craft, but until the outbreak of war with the Dominion these fighters had rarely before seen extended combat actions in space.</p>
        <p>During the Dominion war, vast numbers of Starfleet fighter craft were lost to the superior firepower and speed of Jem'Hadar fighters, and despite the valiant efforts of existing craft, there were no real equivalents that could match these enemies for sheer speed and overwhelming rate of fire and accuracy.</p>
        <p>Starfleet Research and Development at this time were unable to sacrifice the time, or resources to adequately facilitate research into a potential new fighter craft with materiel and personnel stretched almost to breaking point in an attempt to fabricate new technologies and spare parts to aid the front line battle forces and it was with this in mind that the project was outsourced to the defence contract agency Wolfestar Systems, based in the Bolian outlier systems.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the Wolfestar development complex was destroyed almost completely in the conflicts along the Bolian front in early 2374 as the newly reassigned Sixth Fleet clashed with Dominion Forces, and the project data was presumed lost.</p>
        <p>In late 2378 however, recovery teams from Wolfestar's now re-established headquarters on Bolias discovered that the backup data core maintained in vaults deep underground had escaped almost unscathed and amongst the recovered data were found the almost completed specifications for the new fighter.</p>
        <p>With approval and continued support from Starfleet Research and Development, the project was completed in late 2380 and the lead design advisor for Starfleet, Fleet Captain Andrew Robinson named the craft and its class Templar, in honour of its flagship role protecting Federation citizens rights to free travel.</p>
        <p>The Templar Class Fighter is a multifunction red zone combat craft capable of fulfilling a number of varied roles including, but not limited to :</p>

        <p>The primary frame of the Templar Class Fighter Craft is composed of fabricated duranium/tritanium macrofilament truss frames connected using transporter welding techniques. This basic framework provides physical integrity to the craft at rest.</p>
        <p>A secondary framework of aluminium crystalfoam stringers are phase transition welded to the primary framework to prevent the extreme vibrational stresses suffered at high impulse manoeuvring speeds.</p>
        <p>Due to size and mass constraints, rather than the traditional secondary hull provided in larger, less manoeuvrable craft, the Templar utilises reinforcing micro extruded terminium plating, transporter welded into the primary frameworks, themselves reinforced and separated with polyduranide rodding.</p>
        <p>The Templar nose is formed by a rounded, elongated triangular design, sweeping back into shortened, but wide, equidistant wings similar to the 'Delta Flyer' of the U.S.S Voyager, widened to become a more permanent part of the main fuselage, attaching to an aft, extended engine compartment with a single, wide range Impulse exhaust vent.</p>

        <p>Previous fighter craft, such as the Argus and Peregrine Classes have used a standard computer system adapted from the larger Shuttlecraft Classes, and using the LCARS operating system, and the MAJEL user interface however the nature of the Templar, and it's intended use during high speed close combat, precludes the use of such a generalised set of operating software, and so it was determined that a faster, more efficient, specialised operating system and interface were required.</p>
        <p>The Templar utilises a bioneural assisted isolinear data core, with bioneural interlinks to all other systems, shielded with EM and graviton reflective polyduranide sheeting to prevent system interference.</p>
        <p>When designing the Templar Operating System, Wolfestar took into account the need for a simplified series of command pathways that would yield maximum speed and efficiency with minimum energy requirements and minimum processor load. It was with this in mind that Wolfestar Computer Innovations Systems Department created the Reduced Instruction Set Command and Control System, or RISCCS. When tested, RISCCS surpassed all possible expectations, processing command and control operations at an average speed of 9,300 kiloquads/sec, more than twice the speed of an isolinear data core utilising the LCARS operating system.</p>
        <p>It was plain that using the standard MAJEL interface of keyboard and voice was impractical in the high speed world of fighter combat, and to complement RISCCS a simplified Interface was needed. It was with this in mind that the Computer Innovations Systems Department came through once more with the Command Operations Management Tactical control interface, or COMTAC.</p>
        <p>COMTAC provides a verbal interface ability, used primarily for combat operations, able to handle complex strings of commands, including the rerouting of power and the manipulation of shielding, weaponry, propulsion, automated damage control systems, and all other primary and secondary systems, displaying system status through a three dimensional Heads Down Display across a series of chest height mounted display panels. There is also a tactile interface that allows manipulation of systems through the status display panels, rather than a keyboard system, though this is used primarily in non combat operations, when time is not a factor in systems control.</p>

        <p>The Templar is incapable of faster than light travel, as adding a Warp Propulsion System was impractical given space constraints. Main propulsion is provided by a single medium fusion generator, housed in the rear third of the craft. This generator contains an auxiliary boost system, capable of providing emergency acceleration thrust to 0.43c, albeit for extremely short periods of time. Enough to escape a dangerous situation or accelerate into one should the need arise. Deceleration in comparison to acceleration using the boost system is slower. but inescapable as the .25c impulse system isn't capable of maintaining such a rapid pace and relativistic concerns are enhanced in a smaller craft.</p>
        <p>Because of the increased maximum speed and the low acceleration times, the hull is lined with more than 200 mini Inertial Dampening Field generation units, providing over 300% more inertia dampening capability than standard, augmented by equivalent Structural Integrity Field generators, providing sufficient added hull integrity to survive extended travel at .92c. Considered overkill by some, it gives the Templar the redundancy that Wolfestar is known throughout the galaxy for.</p>
        <p>Due to its lack of warp capability, the Templar relies on carrier support to ferry it from target to target, although it has a series of magnetic grappling systems along the lower hull, which allow it to attach itself to the outer hull of a willing vessel, tagging along as that vessel makes a warp journey, and detaching once a destination is reached.</p>

          <p>The Templar is equipped with a single modified Type IV shield generator contained within the aft secondary spaces between the COMTAC routing system and Computer Core. This modified system consists of a cluster of twelve 16MW graviton polarity sources feeding a single 900 millicochrane subspace field distortion amplifier, producing an output of 192 MW and a maximum primary energy dissipation rate of approximately 52,123 kW, though powering shielding at maximum levels reduces the effective output of the main pulse phaser cannons, and is designed primarily to function at that power level only in conjunction with the microtorpedo load in strafing operations against larger craft. At approximately 65% of this power rating, the main pulse phaser cannons are at maximum effectiveness.</p>

        <div class="section" title="Phaser Systems">

          </div>
          <p>Following the success of the Defiant Class weapons systems, it was deemed appropriate by Wolfestar's Tactical Systems Department to incorporate a similar, if less powerful design into the Templar. Above the main nose are mounted a pair of fixed pulse phaser cannons with a single forward firing angle. This fixture is mirrored below the nose. altogether forming a quad set.</p>
          <p>Due to the power requirements and overheating issues inherent in providing such powerful primary weapons for a fighter craft, it is not possible to fire all four cannons simultaneously for extended periods of time, and as such, standard firing is conducted in a linear sequence, a single barrel at a time, though they can also be linked into a dual fire mode with reductions of up to 50% in shield power to prevent complete power drain and for shorter periods of time, a full quad fire mode, primarily used only on significantly larger targets.</p>

          <p>Unlike other fighter craft, the Templar is designed to function as an extended use large craft strike unit, and it was with that in mind that the Wolfestar Ballistic Projectile Division added wings to the initial design, that serve no aerodynamic or manoeuvring purpose, but are instead solely intended as torpedo firing platforms.</p>
          <p>Each wing contains a single microtorpedo tube, supplied by a high capacity, quick loading belt system. The wings, with an internal dimension of 16.5 cubic metres are of sufficient size to contain a standard payload of 100 microtorpedo's each, in a reinforced magazine, linked directly to the loading belt mechanism.</p>
          <p>The torpedo loading system is capable of reloading the single torpedo tube within 2.4 seconds due to its unique solid belt design, reloading the belt behind a 24 torpedo buffer stock.</p>

        <p>Unlike similar design craft, the cockpit is hidden beneath ablative armour reinforced shielding, sunk ahead of the main computer core, to either side of the wings. With the seat set to an ergonomic 16 degree rear angle, the pilot has a series of four monitor screens directly before his eyes. Each screen in this manner links to a series of visual sensors capable of projecting on each of these screens a visual from any angle, though the two centre screens by default provide forward views to aid in navigation.</p>
        <p>Directly below these screens, requiring some minor lowering of the head are a series of 6 smaller screens and one central larger screen depicting primary and secondary system status in any customisable format, though the default settings are:</p>
        <ul class="Screen Layouts simplelist">

Using this method it will highlight any targets classified as critical threat and issue an audible warning, highlighting that threat on the main forward screen if visible within that range.</li>

        <p>Primary flight control is provided by the standard auxiliary helm control stick, as supplied for larger Starships. This control stick utilises thumb and finger control mechanisms for weapons select and a larger forefinger control to fire selected weapons. Torpedo's and phasers can be fired, and weapons selected using the Voice COMTAC interface, though this procedure is of course slowed by the need for speech.</p>
        <p>Velocity and engine power are controlled by a raised control lever, which provides combat COMTAC access through a thumb key along the right hand side. Depression of this key provides the same input as the "TAC" mode of verbal address which itself is an adaptation of the more traditional "Computer" mode of address.</p>

        <p>Because of its nature as a none warp capable fighter craft, the Templar cockpit is designed to function as an extended duration life pod. Upon verbal or emergency tactile request, the cockpit is blown away from the main craft using explosive bolt devices, small, shaped, solid state explosives, driving the cockpit, including its armour panelling away from the craft at approximately 4 m/s. Once ejected, the cockpit systems are powered by an emergency micro fission generator with a battery backup, providing approximately 72 hours of continuous life support, or 300 hours if the emergency medkit is used to induce sleep.</p>
        <p>Provided a larger friendly craft is in site, the life pod will activate, small reaction control thrusters to propel the lifeboat at 16 m/s towards that craft, emitting a coded or open frequency emergency distress signal. Once within range, the larger craft can tractor the pod in, or transport the pilot aboard.</p>
        <p>In case of landing on a planetary or atmospheric body, the life pod systems are capable of recharging through solar power cells. The pod contains a three day emergency ration kit, medkit and a Type IIIa Pulse Compression Phaser Rifle with twelve spare charged power packs.</p>

        <p>The Templar utilises a standard environmental control system which provides air to the cockpit compartment, and can be adapted to provide air to other areas of the craft for the purposes of emergency repairs whilst in space. Other areas are reached via small crawlways which run the length and width of the craft, centred on the Cockpit area.</p>
        <p>Subspace communications are provided by a modified antenna array tied directly into the COMTAC Interface and controlled by a pad activated by the left foot. When depressed this triggers the communications subroutine and verbal input is required to direct encrypted communications to a target e.g. depressing the pad and calling "Red 2" would place the pilot in contact with the craft designated Red 2. Communications systems can be accessed directly through Far Right Panel 1 of the status display screens, using the tactile screen interface.</p>
        <p>Pilot ablution and sanitation facilities are provided by a series of flight suit mounted tubing which carry waste away and recycle it using a primitive replicator device, converting it to pure water for the pilot's emergency supply and general convenience.</p>

        <p>The Templar Class Heavy Fighter is the leading edge of Starfleet's commitments to further fighter production and is now in mass production. Doubtless it will prove itself to be the preferred and primary multipurpose combat fighter in use by Starfleet. Wolfestar systems have proven themselves more than capable of matching Starfleet Research and Development in the production of cutting edge craft and technology, which will very likely lead to profitable partnerships in the future.</p>
        <p>Multi purpose, simplified control mechanisms make this the future of all further fighter designs and will no doubt become the benchmark as this class bridges the gaps in current fighter theology and tactical practice.</p>
