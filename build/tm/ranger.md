History and Mission Overview {.title}
----------------------------

"Now boys I reckon this is it...nuclear combat toe to toe with the
Ruskies."

—Major T. J. "King" Kong

As the Dominion war began to heat up, Star Fleet strategists realized
that the general combat modified Valhalla class runabouts, were of
little military value when used to make tactical strikes upon larger
combat vessels. It was decided that what Star Fleet needed was a small,
easy to mass produce combat vessel capable of warp speeds, and armed
with sufficient weaponry to become a distracting threat to enemy task
force operations until reinforcements could arrive. The mission profile
upon the beginning of the design process is still adhered today is as
follows:

-   To defend outposts at strategic locations.
-   To patrol along established boarders and space lanes.
-   To conduct protective screening for merchant convoys.
-   To perform medium range tactical reconnaissance.
-   Act as a combined forward strike force which could outflank an enemy
    formation and/or garrison to hit the enemy where and when they least
    expect it.

Structure and Construction {.title}
--------------------------

"I don't think it's quite fair to condemn the whole program because of a
single slip up."

—General "Buck" Turgidson

The Ranger's space frame consists of a duranium/tritanium plasma
tempered alloy. The hull is a sandwich of layers. Each layer is 2cm
thick, consisting of duranium, tritanium, and plexiprine. On top of that
is a .5cm layer of ablative armor. This multi layering has a dual
purpose. It adds strength to the overall spacecraft structure, while
allowing the spacecraft to absorb energy more efficiently. In addition,
the Ranger's nose and leading edges have a total of .75cm of ablative
armor for added protection during head on attacks. The canopy is
standard transparent aluminum with a thickness of 4cm. In general
appearance: The Ranger has a main fuselage that houses 80% of it's
operating systems. Including the impulse drive, power units, warp core,
and sensory systems. Jutting forward is a smooth, elongated nose which
houses a crew cockpit. In an emergency the cockpit can be jettisoned
from the main section and act as a life boat for the crew. Four, broad,
deep delta wings are located on either side of the main section in
pairs, each pair with a weapons or other mission specific hard point on
the outer tip of the wing. A dorsal blister houses the type-5 phaser
array. Upon the aft section of the main fuselage is the variable
geometry plasma exhaust vent for the dual impulse drives. Crew access
into the Ranger is through a hatch located on the port aft section of
the cockpit which lowers down from the fuselage, and is equipped with
"steps" for easy access. There is also an emergency hatch located above
and slightly aft of the cockpit.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems {.title}
----------------------------------

"Now I've been to one world fair, a picnic and a rodeo and that's the
stupidest thing I've heard come over a set of earphones. Are you sure
you got today's codes?"

—Major T. J. "King" Kong

The Ranger is equipped with a sensory suite that enables it to scan
regions of space in a 4.5 light year radius in high resolution, and 17
light years in low resolution. There is also an ECM (electronic counter
measures) suite installed on the Ranger. This suite is capable of
producing sensory ghosts, and confusing enemy targeting systems by
either jamming, or overlapping an enemies sensory frequencies with
altered information for a distance up to and including 1000km. Although
it is at a reduced efficiency at such distances. The ECM suite is most
efficient when activated at distances of 500km or less. The Ranger also
houses a small subspace decoy launcher which contains 8 decoys. These
decoys generate a strong short ranged subspace distortion field capable
of distracting the acquisition scanners of most known types of guided
munitions. Effective range of the subspace decoy is 100km.

### Optional Sensory Equipment {.title}

For use in extended range reconnaissance, the Ranger can exchange it's
wing tip munitions for a sophisticated sensory pod. Total time for the
weapons/sensory pod exchange is approximately 3 hours because of the
sophistication of the systems involved. Equipped in such a way, the
Ranger's high resolution range is increased to a radius of 6 light
years, with an 18 light year range at low resolution. The additional
sensory/computer pods also allow the revamped Ranger to effectively jam
or confuse approximately 95% of all known targeting systems to a radius
of 10,000 km. This diminishes towards 75% at 15,000km, and 50% at a
radius of 20,000km. Even so, this makes the Reconnaissance Ranger a
potent asset to a combined fighter/fighter bomber attack by providing
long range targeting acquisition and tactical information. And an ECM
field in which the attacking squadron can deploy with an adequate anti
targeting sensor envelope.

### Computer Systems {.title}

A multi grafted isolinear core, housing over 130 separate isolinear
chips. The entire computer core is shielded against radiation with a 1cm
layer of tetraburnium sandwiched between two 5mm layers of duranium. For
ease of maintenance, the Main Computer Core is of a single module that
can be disconnected and replaced with a spare in seconds. This design
trades off the ability of being repaired in-flight for that of rugged
dependability.

Warp Propulsion Systems {.title}
-----------------------

"Tell you what you do, baby: you just start your countdown, and old
Bucky'll be back before you can say 'Blast off!'"

—General Turgidson

The Ranger is a powered by a warp core rated at 500 conchranes. The core
is mounted lengthwise along the centerline within the lower section of
the main fuselage. The warp drive is capable of giving the Ranger a
Cruising velocity of Warp 5.5 for 72 hours, with a Maximum Sustainable
Velocity of Warp 6.0, and a Maximum Velocity of Warp 6.5 for 12 hours.
The warp drive is also equipped to produce a micro warp field to
decrease the effects of relativistic distortions during high sub light
speeds. It had been debated on whether to mount bussard scoops along the
Ranger's leading and trailing edges of it's wing. But the space and
structural requirements forced the omission from the final design. In
point of fact: The bussard vents would have added so much mass and
volume to the Ranger as to reduce its over all military capability.

Impulse Propulsion Systems {.title}
--------------------------

The Ranger is equipped with dual impulse engines for sub light
propulsion. This unique "twin engine" design allows the Ranger to
operate at an increased range, and better thrust to rate ratios, at a
slightly lower cost in fuel then using a standard, larger impulse unit.
It also has the added advantage of allowing the Ranger to maneuver even
if one impulse engine has been damaged. The dual impulse engines are
housed within a 3cm thick tritanium "box", and are separated by a 4cm
thick bulkhead within the box to prevent one damaged drive from
affecting the other. The thrust generated from each impulse engine is
funneled into its own variable geometry exhaust vent. Each vent has a
maximum deflection of 15 degrees from the centerline, both vertical and
horizontal to help decrease the Ranger's turning radius (vectored
thrust). For ease of maintenance, the entire vent assembly can be
detached in order to slide the impulse drives from their armored box.
The engines can be replaced and the vent re-attached in 15 minutes by a
skilled ground crew. Each impulse engine is capable of powering the
Ranger to 0.20c for 16.5 hours. Together, the dual impulse drives can
propel the Ranger to speeds of 0.28c for 25 hours. For an extra boost of
speed in emergency circumstances, the Ranger can utilize it's warp drive
to create a micro warp envelope, allowing the Ranger to operate at 0.35c
for 1 hour.

Tactical Systems {.title}
----------------

"You can't fight in here, this is the War Room!"

—President Merkin Muffley

### Shields {.title}

4 Mark-7 shield deflectors. Each capable of generating a 350
miliconchrane subspace distortion field and are powered by two 24 MW
fusion reactors. Combined, the deflectors are capable of a graviton load
displacement up to 240.0 MW, with a maximum energy dissipation rate in
excess of 3.65 x 10\^3 KW.

### Armament {.title}

4 type-5 tetryon pulse cannons mounted in the nose to fire forward only.
Each tetryon cannon produces a 45% greater energy yield then standard
phasers of the same size. Within the discharge chamber of the cannon,
there is located a phased ionic pulse emitter, a metaphasic field
generator, and a subspace transducer coil. When a phased ionic pulse
comes into contact with the metaphasic field, it creates a mass of
tetryon particles. The subspace transducer coil then envelops the
tetryon particles with a subspace containment field. Once the field has
been condensed to a predetermined size (depending on the desired energy
yield), the subspace coil then polarizes the field and accelerates it
out towards the target. Tetryons by definition are only stable within
the confines of subspace, and are highly unstable in normal space. Thus,
once the subspace/tetryon charge interacts with an object occupying
normal space, the subspace field desolves and the entire kinetic energy
stored within the compressed tetryonic charge is released. Each cannon
has a recharge rate of 0.25 seconds, and can have a sustained maximum
firing rate of 240 pulses per minute for 5 minutes. Effective range is
15,000km with a maximum pulse energy of 0.27 MW. Firing arc is forward
only.

Two wing tip mounted weapons pods. Each capable of carrying either 30
minitorps, OR one Mark-IV photon torpedo. Maximum range of the minitorp
launcher is 175,000km. Maximum range for the Mark IV photorp is
350,000km. Both sets of munitions are guided.

One standard Type-5 phaser emitter in a dorsal blister mount located in
the above aft section of the main fuselage. Continuos beam energy output
is 0.18 MW for a duration of 10 minutes. Maximum range is 9,000km. The
Firing arch is 360 degrees with up to 90 degrees of elevation.

Utility Systems {.title}
---------------

"Goldie, how many times have I told you guys that I don't want no
horsing around on the airplane."

—Major T. J. "King" Kong

### Auxiliary Power {.title}

4 type-34 fusion reactors. Maximum energy output of 12.0 MW each.

### Tractor/Repulsor Systems {.title}

One M-2 tractor emitter capable of structurally handling objects up to
20 metric tons for 150 hours.

### Transporter Systems {.title}

The seats of the Ranger houses an emergency transporter pad capable of
beaming it's occupant a maximum distance of 250km from the Ranger.

Crew Support Systems {.title}
--------------------

"Shoot! A fella could have a pretty good weekend in Vegas with all that
stuff."

—Major T. J. "King" Kong

### Control Systems {.title}

The Ranger has a triple set of controls. One for each member of the
crew. Although each set of controls are configured for a specific
purpose, they are able to access every function onboard the Ranger. In
addition, the Pilot's main flight controls are a manual joystick and
lever mounted on the armrests of the flight seat. The left joystick
controls pitch, roll, and yaw, and the firing of the Tetryon Cannons.
While the right lever controls the throttle for both warp and impulse,
activation of the micro warp field, and retractable speed brakes
(mounted in 4 main panels along the upper and lower fuselage for
decreasing velocity while in a planet's atmosphere). The Weapon's
Officer's controls handle the ship to ship communication, sensory scans,
all weapons targeting systems, and navigation. While the Flight
Engineer's controls manage propulsion, life support, and other
subsystems. It was decided that a three man crew would reduce the work
load of the crewmembers while maintaining a peek level of proficiency.

### Life Support {.title}

Although the Ranger has a standard cockpit life support system, it
isrecommended that the crew wear and EVA flight suit during combat
maneuvers. Also, the entire crew compartment can be separated from the
Ranger and used as a life pod. As a life pod, the crew compartment is
equipped with small maneuvering thrusters to aid in the separation and
maneuvering away from the Ranger. It is shaped and material designed to
be able to re-entered a Class M planet's atmosphere safely. Emergency
life support is good for 72 hours for a crew of 3. The crew compartment
is equipped with three seats, and a rear storage locker equipped with a
food replicater and a full complement of emergency survival gear for 3
crewmen up to 3 days. This includes three flight suits, a small life
support pod, emergency food and water rations, three type-2 hand
phasers, three solar blankets, a first aid kit, a portable fusion
generator, 4 bio-chemical lamps, and a portable emergency subspace
transmitter. The small life support pod can be attached to a crewman's
flight suit while in EVA to extend the duration of the suit's life
support for a maximum of three days per crewman. Each flight suit is
equipped with a nutritional IV packet. Upon activation by the crewman,
the packet releases a predetermined dosage of nutrients within a
specified time interval.

Also included for each crewmember is a miniature survival kit complete
with one combination Cardasian phrase book and Bible, one hundred slips
of latinum, nine packs of Double Juicy Fruit Gum, one issue box of 12
prophylactics, three lipsticks, three pairs of nylon stockings, and a
1kg bar of chocolate.

Conclusion {.title}
----------

Recently, several Ranger bomber crews have taken to the age old
tradition of "Nose Art". Giving their craft comical names and painting
rather intricate characters or cartoons upon the nose. Although such
practice is usually frowned upon, there is no definitive regulation
against the practice. Examples of such endowments include:

-   Cartman's Authorita!
-   Diamond Lil
-   Garfield's Folly
-   Lonesum Joe
-   Midnight Delight
-   Pistol Pack'n Mamma
-   Queen Desiree
-   Santa's Little Helper
