History and Mission Overview {.title}
----------------------------

"God I hate being right all the time."

—Dr. Ian Malcolm

Following heavy losses to Cardassian fighters and Jem'Hadar Attack Ships
during the early stages of the Dominion War, Star Fleet decided to
develop a new fighter to act as a counter-measure against small enemy
vessels. The project utilised the technology used to develop the USS
Defiant and the Type-X shuttlecraft to produce an advanced interceptor
capable of taking on enemy fighter craft.

During the early stages of the project, Star Fleet approached Avalon
Fleet Yards, which had been working on various tactical systems, to be
the production base of the new Interceptor.

During initial testing, it became apparent that small numbers of
Compsognathus Interceptors were ineffective, and as a result, the
fighters were designed to operate in high numbers.

The end result was a single-pilot Interceptor that was manoeuvrable and
had effective weaponry for its anti-fighter role. It was christened
"Compsognathus" after a species of small dinosaur that was dangerous
when it hunted in large packs.

The following are intended roles for the Compsognathus Class
Interceptor.

-   Interception of enemy fighters
-   Support of main Attack Wings
-   Massed attacks against large targets
-   Air support for ground troops

Structure and Construction {.title}
--------------------------

"We've taken every precaution."

—John Hammond

The Compsognathus is built from standard tritanium and duranium alloys.
It's dimensions measure 9.81m x 5.96m x 3.67m.

From above, the nose of the craft is flat, extending into long curves
reaching 6m along the length of the craft. The remaining length is
straight lines, with two 'wings' extending from this surface.

From the front, the main body of the craft is a mirrored shape, with a
flat surface turning into a curved side. The 'wings' are located halfway
up the craft.

Locations {.title}
---------

"Clever girl."

—Robert Muldoon

Sensory units are found to the front of the ship.

The Cockpit is found in the one third of the way along the front of the
shuttle, from the nose. The pilot sits in a small compartment, with the
craft's controls directly in front. Status displays are on the left,
sensor data to the right. A view screen inside the cockpit's cover gives
the pilot visual information about the space around him/her, should the
pilot desire it.

Environmental systems, communications systems and a microfusion
generator are attached to the Cockpit, within the craft.

The phaser armament is located beneath the cockpit, in the belly of the
craft. Micro-torpedo launchers are found within the wings.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems {.title}
----------------------------------

"You've bred raptors?"

—Dr. Alan Grant

The Compsognathus uses a computer core similar to the type-X
shuttlecraft. This comprises of 5 polled processor segments, with two
back up bio-neural gel pack based processors should the main unit be
damaged or suffer a failure for other reasons.

Like the engines, the sensor packages on the Compsognathus are scaled
down versions of starship sensors. These are combined with an [Emissions
Tracking System](ets.html "Emissions Tracking System"). Cloak Detection
is a possibility for the Compsognathus via the ETS, although the craft
has no means by which it can de-cloak a threat vessel.

Impulse Propulsion Systems {.title}
--------------------------

"Go go go go go go GO!"

—Dr. Ian Malcom

The Compsognathus interceptor has no Warp Propulsion System, so it is
dependant on a carrier craft to transport it to and from different
theatres of operation.

Impulse propulsion is based around a sub-scaled version of standard
starship Impulse Propulsion Systems. This is coupled with shuttlecraft
Reaction Control System (RCS) packages taken from Type-VI shuttlecraft
to give a high level of manoeuvrability. The Compsognathus has no
problem keeping up with other fighters during combat.

The maximum sustained speed for the Compsognathus is 0.35c, where c is
the speed of light.

Tactical Systems {.title}
----------------

"They should all be destroyed!"

—Robert Muldoon

The basic defensive systems of the Compsognathus Class mirror those used
by most shuttlecraft with regards to shields and signal jamming devices.

In addition, the Compsognathus was fitted with 1cm of Ablative armour
for added protection in combat.

The two 'wings' each contain a micro-torpedo launcher, each with 30
micro-torpedoes. These are intended to be used along side the phaser
armament of the Interceptor. The Phaser armament can be either two
standard Type-V Phaser emitters or two Type-V Pulse Phaser cannon. These
weapons are interchangeable between missions.

Crew Support Systems {.title}
--------------------

"Call the mainland. Tell them to send a chopper."

—Dr. Alan Grant

The Compsognathus Class includes standard RF and subspace communications
equipment. It also has an encoded-channel system designed to allow
pilots within a squadron or wing to co-ordinate efforts.

A small atmospheric recycling system is installed behind the cockpit to
allow prolonged survival. Should this fail, the compressed air tanks
contain enough breathable atmosphere for 8 hrs. Because of the
differences between races, each craft must have the environmental
systems tailored to the pilot's requirements.

In an emergency, the Cockpit is designed to separate and act as a
lifeboat. Communications systems act as a distress signal/homing beacon.
Environmental systems are attached to the Cockpit, which also includes
survival rations, to help ensure pilot survival.

Conclusion {.title}
----------

"After careful consideration, I've decided not to endorse your park."

—Dr. Alan Grant

The Compsognathus Class Interceptor has now gone into mass production,
serving as a support fighter to the heavier classes such as the Icarus,
providing protection against enemy fighters and smaller ships.
