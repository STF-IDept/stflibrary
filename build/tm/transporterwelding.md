Description {.title}
-----------

With a Transport Weld, two frame pieces are formed into one piece by
transporting a joint piece into both frame pieces at the desired
location. Stress is then redistributed through the system once the whole
space frame is finished by gamma radiation treatments. The result is a
strong joint that cleanly and effectively passes stress and force
without buckling or breakage. This also reduced the need for Integrity
Field Reinforcement Bars, by some 90%, and cuts space frame
manufacturing time by some 6 months time compared to ship that used
conventional technology.
