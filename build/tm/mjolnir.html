        <p>Project Sledgehammer was born at Starfleet Research and Development in response to requests from several influential starship captains and engineers to provide an alternative to the venerable, yet still flawed, Nimitz-class. When the Federation Council caught wind of the Project, they balked at approving it, given recent approval to revisions to the Nimitz. In making their case to free up resources for the Project, R&amp;D pointed out that an unsettling majority of new races being discovered by Starfleet employed fighters as a critical part of their tactical strategies, and despite having fighters, the Fleet lacked an appropriate fighter platform. Since the end of the Kansas Project, several Nimitz captains had modified their vessels to serve as carriers, but according to Project head Fleet Captain Jackson White, such modifications were akin to early 20th Century aircraft carriers; simply battleships with carrier decks bolted on, not true carriers.</p>
        <p>Project Sledgehammer, White argued, would provide the Federation and Starfleet with a ship that would serve as a true carrier starship, filling the hole left by the decommissioning of the Kansas-class and allowing the fleet to utilize its fighter wings as something other than space station defenses. It would also provide the fleet with an alternative to the Nimitz, similar in size and weapons capacity, but without several of the extraneous features that were rarely used anyway. His argument swayed the Council into providing approval for Project Sledgehammer to create two prototype ships, at which point the Council would re-evaluate the Project.</p>
        <p>On Stardate 09051.4 the Council was aboard the USS Mjolnir, the first prototype ship of her class to be produced by the Project. They observed the full range of the ship’s capabilities: as a carrier, a heavy weapons platform, and a tactical center of a type typically only seen on Starbases. Thoroughly impressed with the design team from Project Sledgehammer, the Federation Council authorized a production run of five additional ships: one for each Fleet with one held in reserve.</p>
        <p>As described by Fleet Captain White at the initial defense of the Project, the Mjolnir’s mission capabilities include, but are not limited to the following:</p>

        <p>Mjolnir-class ships are designed to function as workhorses for the fleets they are assigned, with multiple mission profiles. As such, the design team working for the Project decided to base the general shape of the ship on a spaceframe that had served as a workhorse for Starfleet since the mid-23rd century: the Miranda-class. This decision was one of the most-criticized aspects of the design and building process, as many designers noted that advancements in technology since the 2250s had made the Miranda obsolete. In response, the Project’s designers justified their choice of shape by pointing out that a “flying saucer” was easier to defend by virtue of not having to worry abut a stardrive section to create blind spots for the ventral weapons systems. Critics were further assured that the Project builders would not be simply ‘big-ifying’ the Miranda frame, but merely using it as a guide, and would construct the ship using modern techniques, supplies, and equipment.</p>
        <p>To fulfill all the mission profiles the ship would be assigned, the design team drastically expanded the Miranda design from its original 277.76m x 173.98m x 65.23m to a much larger 874.9m x 548m x 205.5m, while also inverting the nacelle placement and eliminating the “roll-bar” possessed by some Miranda-class ships. Construction of the Mjolnir class began with the joining of four U-frames via transporter welding at Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards.</p>
        <p>Two "bubbles" on the dorsal and ventral surfaces house critical systems.  The dorsal bubble is home to a sensor array, while the ventral bubble houses part of the ship’s weapons capacities.  An opening exists on decks eleven through fifteen for access to the ship’s central hangar.  Deflector systems are located on deck twenty-nine.  There are a total of thirty five decks aboard the ship, with an average deck measurement of 5m.  Due to their placement atop rather than below the main hull, the warp nacelles are not counted towards the deck count, leaving 177m of deck space.</p>
        <p>Mjolnir-class ships are constructed with an 87-13 duranium-tritanium alloy mix.  In addition to standard ablative armor, Mjolnir-class ships are equipped with additional tritanium armor plating concentrated around vital areas like the Hangar Bay doors and torpedo bubble.  This makes those areas more resistant to damage inflicted by enemy weapons.</p>

        <p>Mjolnir-class ships have a highly sophisticated sensor suite for a ship of its size. A Mjolnir comes equipped with a Type VIII sensor suite that can detect and identify objects within 3.8 light-years at high resolution, and 12.3 light-years at low resolution. The primary sensor suite is located in the dorsal "bubble" on deck one.</p>
        <p>The ship’s computer systems are large, and focused on accommodating multiple data retrieval and computing requests at once. A three-core isolinear main system stretches from decks seven through thirteen, with an additional isolinear core located on decks twenty through twenty-one which is used for additional computing power when the ship is serving as a battle coordinator. The computer system runs Starfleet’s standard LCARS and MAJEL interfaces.</p>
        <p>The Mjolnir is equipped with an Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH) Mark IV program in its Sickbay. The EMH is automatically activated in the event of a combat alert. </p>

        <p>The ship is outfitted with a 1618 Cochrane Class-VIII warp core as its main power source. Despite the size of the ship, with its immense power requirements, the warp core is able to provide most of the power needed, in conjunction with the fusion generators that power the impulse engines.</p>
        <p>The warp core is located on decks fourteen through twenty, with the main reactor assembly located in main engineering on decks sixteen, seventeen and eighteen. The nacelles are attached to the fantail of deck two and are actually integrated into the spaceframe.  The nacelles are connected to the warp core by plasma conduits leading from main engineering to the warp plasma manifolds in the nacelles.</p>
        <p>In the event of an emergency, a Mjolnir is capable of ejecting its warp core.  Upon initiation of this process, the main reactor assembly detaches from its fuel lines and is “pushed” out of the ship via a hatch just the appropriate size in the aft section of decks fourteen through twenty. This hatch is how replacement cores are brought aboard upon return to a suitably equipped starbase or to drydock.</p>
        <p>The Mjolnir’s warp system allows it to achieve a cruising speed of Warp 6, a maximum sustainable speed of Warp 7.5, and a maximum 12-hour emergency speed of Warp 9.7.</p>

        <p>Due to the immense power requirements of propelling ships of the class at sublight speed, the Mjolnir-class is equipped with four large impulse engines, each powered by two large fusion generators. The engines and generators are located together on decks ten, eleven and twelve.</p>
        <p>Despite the presence of so many large engines, a Mjolnir-class ship is only capable of .25c. This allows the rest of the power generated by the fusion generators to be diverted to the rest of the ship, ensuring that the lights stay on when wanted, and even provide auxiliary power should the warp core shut down or be ejected.</p>

          <p>The Mjolnir-class is equipped with a two-layer shield system. The primary shields are Type-12, the largest allowed on any starship. They provide a Max Graviton Load of 2688 megawatts (MW) alongside a Max Dissipation Rate of 7.3x10^5 kilowatts (kW).</p>
          <p>In the event the primary shields are compromised, a secondary Type-8 shield system is in place to protect the ship. The Type-8 shields provide a Max Graviton Load of 1344 MW and a Max Dissipation Rate of 3.7x10^5 kW.</p>
          <p>Should both the primary and secondary shields fail, a network of emergency forcefields and bulkheads exists throughout the ship to maintain hull integrity. If emergency forcefields or bulkheads are in an area where the outer hull has been compromised, a Mjolnir is limited to speeds below warp factor four to compensate for the additional stress on the Structural Integrity Field.</p>

          <p>The phaser systems on the ship were designed to enable debilitating volleys of near-constant phaser fire forward, and designers provided it with ample weaponry to enable that goal. A Mjolnir’s phaser systems are based around the necessity to first protect the flight deck. Four Type-VIII phaser turrets are placed forward, spread out around the hangar. One is placed on deck twenty, one on deck five, and two on deck seventeen, on either side of the hangar doors.</p>
          <p>To protect the ship’s flanks, two Type X phaser arrays are positioned along the starboard and port sides of the ship, with each array having 250 emitters. These strips are located on deck twenty on both sides, near amidships.  </p>
          <p>Two additional Type X arrays are located on deck two and deck thirty-five aft.  Each array has 250 emitters, and can fire in a 270 degree arc along any axis.</p>
          <p>The ship’s final two Type X arrays are located on the ship’s surfaces, one dorsal and one ventral. The dorsal array is located immediately aft of the Flag Bridge, while the ventral array is located immediately aft of the torpedo bubble. Each array has 250 emitters as well, but due to their positioning, cannot have overlapping fields of fire.</p>

          <p>The Mjolnir-class makes full strategic use of its four torpedo launchers. There are two launchers in the torpedo bubble on deck thirty-five that fire forward, and two that fire aft from deck eleven. With the torpedo launchers so far apart, a Mjolnir has two separate torpedo bays. Each torpedo bay is stocked with 80 photon torpedoes, 40 quantum torpedoes, and 30 reserve torpedo casings used for probes. Torpedo Bay 1 is located on deck eleven, and Torpedo Bay 2 is located on deck thirty-four, feeding the torpedoes down into the launchers.</p>
          <p>In the event of a failure of the automated firing sequence, manual firing stations are set up on decks ten and thirty-four, but the rooms can only be opened by an officer with department head-level authorization.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>In homage to the Kansas-class carrier, the Mjolnir-class was equipped with a Close-In Weapons System (CIWS). The CIWS system is designed to supplement the existing phaser system by concentrating solely on objects within 3 km of the ship, typically fighters, allowing the primary phasers to concentrate fire on capital ships outside that small target area. This also allows the CIWS to provide a higher rate of more concentrated fire, by reducing the area the phaser energy can travel.</p>
          <p>The CIWS is made up of Type VI phaser banks and phaser arrays. There are eight phaser banks and five arrays. Each phaser bank has four emitters, and each array has 150. Each CIWS station is comprised of two phaser banks, with an array in between them, thus there are four stations. Station 1 is positioned on deck two, forward of the Flag Bridge. Station 2 is positioned on deck thirty-five, forward of the torpedo bubble. Stations 3 and 4 are positioned on the bottom of the fantail on deck fourteen. The fifth array is positioned in between stations 3 and 4.</p>
          <p>Operation of the CIWS occurs in the CIC. Upon issuance of a tactical alert, the ship’s Chief Tactical Officer toggles the CIWS from “Inactive” to “Ready.” Automatically, the ship’s computer generates a 1000-kilometer sensor screen around the ship.  Any ship designated as hostile that penetrates that screen is immediately targeted, and is fired upon by at least one of the five stations without any additional action by the CTO if it breaches the 3000m safety screen.</p>

          <p>As a tactical vessel, the Mjolnir’s designers thought it was of paramount importance to create a large area onboard that could serve as a tactical command center for all combat actions, be they major fleet actions or simply the Mjolnir against any number of aggressors. Thus, the Combat Information Center was created. Located on deck twenty-three, the CIC is the size of a Starbase’s Ops Center.</p>
          <p>In the center of the CIC is a ring of sensor information stations. Each station receives information on the battle area, and use holoemitters installed in the consoles to project a three-dimensional representation of local space. Using the information provided, the ship’s Captain can order weapons strikes on various targets, then see the results play out in real time on the holo-display. The CIC computers calculate the damage the strikes cause and update the tactical display accordingly.</p>
          <p>The back wall of CIC is designated for use as a virtual viewscreen: a series of holoemitters are built into the wall to enable it to project an image of an area of space upon command. Upon the request of the CO or duty officer, the viewscreen can be activated to display incoming communications, sensor data, or merely a view of space.</p>
          <p>In addition to the sensor stations and the virtual viewscreen, the CIC is comprised of stations showing the current damage level of the ship and its systems, allowing the command staff to instantly receive damage reports and alter their combat strategy as needed, as well as stations for the Security staff to know the status and location of any of the ship’s personnel.</p>
          <p>The helm, operations, and tactical station form a horseshoe forward of the sensor ring, and face the holodisplay. The helm station controls the pitch, yaw, and roll of the ship.  Operations provides reports on power levels and quick-summary damage reports that lack the depth of those provided by the wall DC consoles (see below), and tactical controls the ship’s weapons and shields.</p>
          <p>Seating for the CO and XO is provided aft of the sensor stations in the form of raised seats that allow the command staff to take a load off their feet while remaining within sight of the holo-display. The walls of CIC – with the exception of the one designated for the viewscreen – are comprised of computer stations that serve as redundant links to various departments, such as Flight Ops for the Air Group, and Sickbay (which displays totals of casualties, separated into wounded and killed), and display Damage Control readouts, and also provide access to the CO’s Ready Room, the Flag Office, the Conference Lounge and the Briefing Lounge.</p>
          <p>Two turbolifts serve the CIC regularly.  In the event of a loss of power, the lift to CIC operates off a dedicated battery system.</p>

          <p>Main Engineering on a Mjolnir is located on decks sixteen, seventeen and eighteen. It spans the entirety of the aft section on those three decks, using the space for the warp core and the matter and anti-matter tanks that provide the ship’s fuel. Main Engineering is also home to several spare parts lockers. There is a Machine Shop located on deck eighteen that, in conjunction with an industrial replicator, enables the engineers on the ship to produce their own spare parts for the ship and the fighter wings.  The presence of the Shop reduces the number of times the ship has to visit Starbases for re-supply.</p>
          <p>The Chief Engineer’s office is located on deck eighteen as well.  In case of an emergency, the CE is able to eject the core and/or re-route power throughout the ship from his office, which can be completely sealed off from the rest of Main Engineering.  This ability also is helpful in giving the CE a small amount of privacy should he desire.</p>

          <p>The Mjolnir’s Security Office is located on deck twenty-nine.  It contains a Squad Room, with desks for an entire shift’s worth of Security officers, a Brig, two interrogation rooms, and a small arms locker containing small-arms such as Type I and II phasers for on-duty security officers. The Squad Room contains a replicator.</p>
          <p>The ship’s Brig is made up of six low-security holding cells comprised of a sixteen square meter room surrounded by bars and a Level Three forcefield, capable of holding four people at a time and four high-security containment cells comprised of an eight square meter room sealed off by a solid bulkhead and an entrance covered by duranium bars and a Level Five forcefield, capable of holding two people at a time. Any officer can access the Brig, but may only enter cells with the approval of a Security officer.</p>
          <p>The interrogation rooms are where security officers question parties involved in the commission of crimes on board the ship.  The rooms themselves are rather Spartan, containing two chairs and a metal table. An observation room is located between the two interrogation rooms, allowing Security officers or JAG representatives to listen in on interrogations.</p>
          <p>The COS’ Office is located adjacent to Interrogation Two, and looks out directly into the Squad Room. Like the CE’s Office, the COS’ Office can also be sealed off from the rest of the Security Office. The COS’ office, however, contains a weapon’s locker that is only accessible with the COS’ Security Override Code and holds six Type III phaser rifles.</p>
          <p>Also on deck twenty-nine, adjacent to the entire Security Office, are two holosuites that can be used to run training simulations for security officers. They are only accessible by the Security Watch Officer. The ship’s Armory and Marine Detachment are headquartered on this deck as well.</p>

          <p>The Armory on a Mjolnir is located adjacent to the Marine Detachment’s headquarters, across the hall from the Security Office. Inside the Armory is a collection of anti-personnel weaponry substantial enough to provide weapons to half the ship’s crew. Weapons available in the Armory include Type III phaser rifles, Type IIIc compression phaser rifles, Type II phaser pistols, Type I phaser pistols, stun grenades, and photon grenades. The Armory also contains body armor designed to absorb and dissipate the energy of a phaser blast. Comprised of a vest, leg padding, and a helmet, this body armor is only issued to Marines and Rapid-Response Security teams who head into combat actions such as repelling boarders, boarding enemy vessels, or hostage rescue situations.  Marine units also have access to such heavy weaponry as Tetryon Pulse Launchers, Isomagnetic Disintegrators, and Photon Mortars.</p>
          <p>Access to the Armory is restricted to the COS, the commander of the Marine detachment, and any crew member with the rank of Lieutenant Commander or above. A quartermaster or quartermaster’s assistant is stationed in the Armory to record who withdraws what.</p>

Each Mjolnir is home to two Marine companies of three hundred Marines each, plus a small Headquarters company that brings the total number of Marines on board to seven hundred and makes the detachment a full Battalion. The Marine officers have offices on deck twenty-nine, where they can deal with disciplinary matters within their ranks, write up and file after-action reports, and meet with naval personnel about Marine involvement in upcoming missions. The detachment also shares time with the Security personnel in the training holosuites, and has its quarters on deck twenty.</p>

          <p>The Mjolnir’s two Cargo Bays are located adjacent to the Flight Decks on decks eleven through fifteen. One is located to starboard, the other to port. Though large enough to hold entire small-end cargo ships, each Cargo Bay is typically occupied by supplies loaded aboard at Starbases but not yet unpacked or catalogued. Each bay maintains a cargo transporter system to facilitate the collection of cargo. In the event of an emergency, the Cargo Bays can also serve as capture bays for the ship’s fighter compliment. There are doors on deck fifteen that allow the fighters landing in the Cargo Bays to make their way into the maintenance area.</p>

          </div>
          <p>As a carrier platform, the Mjolnir’s Tractor Beam is one of her most important pieces of equipment. Located on deck fifteen, below the Flight Decks, the tractor beam – with the paired 16 MW Graviton Polarity Sources producing 32 Mega Watts of Gravity Displacing Power – is effective up to a range (assuming nominal delta-v) of up to 20,000 kilometers. This allows the ship to have a rudimentary assisted-landing system, where pilots – aided by the Tractor Beam – enter the 20,000 kilometer range, decelerate, and allow themselves to be pulled in to the mustering area, at which point the pilots activate their thrusters and maneuver through the forcefield, land the craft, and taxi to their berthing space. This assisted-landing system, however, does not operate under combat conditions due to limitations on the number of fighters it can pull in at once.</p>

          <p>The Mjolnir-class has a large and elaborate transporter system. Due to the immense size, having a few centralized transporter rooms was quickly determined to be infeasible for dispatching boarding parties, SAR-teams, or even receiving dignitaries. Thus, the transporter system on the Mjolnir-class was departmentalized instead.</p>
          <p>There are eight standard transporter rooms aboard a Mjolnir. The first two are located on deck two, and are typically the transporter rooms used for the reception of dignitaries. From these two transporter rooms, the dignitaries may be directed to VIP Quarters, located on deck two, or the Conference Lounge adjacent to the Flag Bridge on deck one.</p>
          <p>The second two are located on deck eight, and are general purpose transporter rooms, beaming crewmembers to Starbases or other ships for purposes not related to capture or assault.</p>
          <p>The final four are located on deck twenty-nine, adjacent to the Security Complex, as well as the headquarters of the Marine detachment. From here, boarding parties can be dispatched to enemy vessels, or friendly vessels in need of assistance repelling boarders. This allows a Mjolnir to more quickly saturate an area with its teams, and provides a greater opportunity for success.</p>
          <p>The emergency transporter rooms aboard the Mjolnir class are primarily for the use of the Medical department. There are a pair that serve the Alpha Sickbay on deck three, and a pair that serve the Beta Sickbay on deck twenty-six. This allows for greater response time by the ship’s medical staff to medical emergencies, and in turn, boosts the injury survival rate.</p>
          <p>The standard transporter rooms have six pads each, and a refresh rate of sixty seconds. The emergency transporter rooms have eight pads each, and a refresh rate of thirty seconds. Pattern buffers are stationed on the deck below each set of rooms.</p>

          <p>Each Mjolnir-class ship has two. As a combat ship with a large crew, it is expected that the ship will see a significant number of battle casualties with each engagement. With that in mind, the designers incorporated two large Sickbays, Alpha Sickbay on deck three, and Beta Sickbay on deck twenty-six, to ensure the best medical treatment possible.</p>
          <p>Alpha Sickbay is the Main Sickbay. It has seventeen biobeds in its main treatment ward, with an additional fifteen beds each in its surgery suite and recovery ward for a total of 47 beds. Beta Sickbay, however, is larger because its location relative to the most populated areas of the ship makes it the default sickbay for crewmembers in Engineering or Security.</p>
          <p>Beta Sickbay is also the Combat Sickbay. It has twenty biobeds in its main treatment ward, with an additional fifteen each in its surgery suite and recovery ward for a total of 50 beds. During combat, it operates on a triage system, where medics treat green-level patients, nurses tend to yellow-level patients, and doctors work on red-level patients.</p>
          <p>The CMO’s office is located in Alpha Sickbay, in an administrative suite adjacent to the main treatment facility.</p>

        <p>As a carrier platform ship, the Mjolnir’s pride and joy is its flight decks. Located on decks eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen and fifteen they house the ship’s two fighter wings, sixteen personnel shuttles, and three runabouts.</p>
        <p>Deck eleven houses Flight Ops, which is where all the activity on the three lower decks is controlled from. Flight Ops has a staff of sixteen which monitor the status of craft outside the ship, as well as those still inside and the maintenance status. The office of the ship’s CAG is located in Flight Ops, as well as the offices of each squadron commander.</p>
        <p>Deck twelve is mainly airspace, but the signal lights that instruct deck crew as to the status of the flight deck are mounted here, as are the intercom speakers Flight Ops crew use to inform deck crew verbally of the flight deck’s condition. The Signal Lights are color-coordinated to squadrons and line the deck; meaning that if Blue Squadron was preparing for launch, a blue light would flash intermittently while the craft were brought up to the deck, then a yellow caution light would illuminate beneath the blue light while the craft were readied, then a red light would flash to alert the deck crew to clear the runway, followed by a green light to signal the squadron they are clear to launch. The intercom system works in conjunction with the signal lights, announcing audibly to the deck crew what squadron is coming up, instructing them to prepare the craft for launch, warning them to clear the runway, and instructing the squadron they are clear to launch. The last command is repeated over the squadron’s comm system.</p>
        <p>Deck thirteen is the main flight deck. All the ship’s auxiliary craft launch from deck thirteen. One of the ship’s six squadrons of fighters is always standing by on deck thirteen, ready for launch. Elevators line each side of the deck, standing by to bring additional craft up from deck fourteen for launch. Squadron ready rooms, as well as the Pilot Briefing Lounge, are located on this deck.</p>
        <p>Decks fourteen and fifteen are the maintenance/repair decks. The squadrons not on standby for launch have their craft stored here while waiting. Here is where all the maintenance and repairs are made to damaged craft.</p>
        <p>A Mjolnir carries two full fighter wings, containing a total of six squadrons, for a total of seventy-two fighters. In addition to this, they carry sixteen Type-VIII personnel shuttles, and three runabouts, used in SAR operations. Mjolnirs do not carry a Captain’s Yacht.</p>

        <p>Now that the Mjolnir-class has entered production, captains dissatisfied with the Nimitz-class are switching ship classes, ending their griping about the problems with the latter class. With fewer griping commanding officers, Starfleet R&amp;D, as well as the Federation Council, can return to designing less deadly, more scientific ships that are best suited for a peacetime fleet. With the Mjolnir-class patrolling the Federation's area of the galaxy, Federation citizens can rest assured that Starfleet is doing their absolute best to protect them from any threats on the horizon.</p>
