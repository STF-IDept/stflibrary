        <p>Late in 2373, the Romulan Empire contacted the Federation for assistance against a new enemy. This enemy struck quickly, without warning, and in large numbers. This enemy was the Crag, the most dangerous enemy the Federation had faced since the Dominion War. During the course of the Crag War, Starfleet forces drove the Crag from world after world, but suffered heavy losses in the process. </p>
        <p>Several types of Crag vessel were encountered during the course of the War, most designed by the Overlords for use by the Crag in a massive territorial grab. Some ships included large dreadnoughts, troop transports, and medium cruisers, but by far the most deadly was what many crews began to call the Furry-class destroyer. These ships were very small in comparison to Federation ships, but were incredibly fast and attacked in large numbers. Federation weapons found them easy to destroy individually, but since they usually operated in large packs of 50 to 100 ships this was a daunting task, one that many Starfleet ships did not survive. Little was known of them during the course of the war, except that they, like most Crag ships, were not very sturdily built, and often were held together with what Alliance Chief Science Officer Hriss referred to as "stick staples." </p>
        <p>When Crell was applied for admission to the Federation in early 2374, Starfleet R&amp;D was granted several of these ships to examine. What they found surprised them. The Furry-class ships were relatively thin-hulled, using a triple-layered vacuum-sealed diamond-laced compressed aluminum hull, not used in the Federation since the orbital vessels of Earth's early 21st century. The interior of the ship was divided not by full-fledged bulkheads but by double-layered vacuum-sealed compressed aluminum of the same variety. This explained why the Furrys were so easy to destroy in small numbers, as well as how the Crag were able to build so many. </p>
        <p>Most parts of the ship were inferior to Starfleet designs, but two items did draw the engineers' attention. The first was the weapons system. Furry weapons consisted of a single phaser array on the front of the ship, slightly less powerful than Federation standard but not by much, and a charged anti-matter magnetic projectile system, also known as anti-matter torpedoes. It was this last item that was significant. (A more complete description is given below, in Tactical Systems.) Powered by the ship's large anti-matter storage facility, it hurled charged packets of anti-matter at a target. While no where near as effective against shields as photon torpedoes, the AMT was deadly against ships' hulls and planetary targets. The second and more important surprising feature was the head. Most Starfleet vessels came equipped with a single chamber pot, usually located near the photon torpedo launchers. This proved to be very inconvenient, especially in ships that were able to separate their saucer section. The Furry, however, had very well equipped facilities, which the constipated engineers found to be quite useful and relieving. </p>
        <p>When Crell was admitted to the Federation, Starfleet realized just what they had in their hands. Crell, as part of its admittance, turned over to Starfleet nearly 5,000 Furry-class destroyers in perfect working order. The Accounting Department refused to allow this twist of fate to go unexploited, and Starfleet immediately began to work to upgrade these ships for Starfleet use. The end result -- a product of cooperation between Starfleet and Crag engineers and private industry -- was the Yub nub Destroyer. The word "yub nub" in Crill, the Crag language, means "freedom," and the designers felt it was only appropriate to name the new prototype in honor of the Crag liberation from the Overlords. The upgrade process took approximately two weeks per ship, and, much to the pleasure of the ever-present Accounting Boys, did not require a large amount of capital. Impressed with the performance of the prototype, Starfleet ordered the entire Crag armada converted into useable Yub nub vessels. The Refit Team consisted of: </p>
        <ul class=" simplelist">
          <li class=" member">Commander Johnathan Denerio, Starfleet R&amp;D </li>
          <li class=" member">Lieutenant Qunya Quenzia, Starfleet Public Relations </li>
          <li class=" member">Protate Warwick Chirpa, Crag Defense Force (CDF)</li>
          <li class=" member">Nyetscape Liaison Vladimir Gustavanov</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The official purpose of the Yub nub was to save money by upgrading existing ships instead of spending the time and effort to design new ones. Eventually, however, the Yub nub Refit Team decided that the Yub nub did have a useful purpose. It's small size and high maneuverability, combined with its ability to maintain a high speed for long periods of time, made the Yub nub well suited for several mission profiles:</p>
        <ul class=" simplelist">
          <li class=" member">Long Range Scout</li>
          <li class=" member">Border Patrol</li>
          <li class=" member">Base Defense</li>
          <li class=" member">Escort</li>
          <li class=" member">Pack Attack Wing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's ability to function independently of larger craft for extended periods of time and the fact that there are a lot of them meant that the Yub nub could be easily deployed for long range scouting missions in deep space or as a lone border patrol craft. In case of emergency when Starfleet would have to be notified of an incident, the Yub nub is unique in that it would be able to outrun most pursuing craft and inform Starfleet itself. It could additionally cover a larger portion of space without resupplying than larger Federation vessels, since it could maintain a higher warp speed for longer periods. 
For offensive strategy, Starfleet learned from the tactics used during the Crag War. A lone Furry-class Destroyer usually faired little chance against most of Starfleet's warships. It's only chance in these situations was to try and avoid being hit and run away. In large numbers, however, the Furry was almost unstoppable, as while the Starfleet ship was targeting one attacker a dozen others were attacking the Starfleet ship from all sides. The Yub nub was more durable than its predecessor, and the Refit Team decided that squadrons of eight ships were the most reasonable offensive strategy. For more defensive tactics, base defense and escort, the Yub nub was grouped into squadrons of three or six ships.</p>

        <p>The Yub nub consists of a single elongated body, three decks tall, tapered slightly to a rounded end fore.  Two fixed warp nacelle pylons extend from rear amidships in a curve downwards, ending in the two nacelles themselves.  The nacelles are roughly 1/2 meter below the main body, and reinforced on the bottom, such that they serve as extra landing skids in addition to the four landing struts that extend out of the bottom of Deck 3.  The Yub nub is capable of repeated takeoff and landing from planetary surfaces with gravitational forces up to 1.9g.  The vessel's dorsal is equipped with the main weapons/sensor array, which houses both the long-range sensors and the projectile tubes for the charged anti-matter magnetic projectile system.</p>
        <p>The Furry-class initially was designed using triple-layered diamond-laced hyper-gague compressed aluminum with sandwiched vacuum-sealed layers. Though not as strong as the titanium hulls used on Starfleet ships, it was enough to maintain pressure and environment for the ship and did not buckle under the stress of rapid vector changes.  However, it also did not meet up with Starfleet safety regulations.  As a result, the refit process included the infusion of a multicarbonate titanium/silicate gel into the vacuum layers, providing increased structural integrity, higher resilience to matter-based and energy-based attacks, and nearly three times the environmental heat retention, with a resulting increase in energy efficiency.  The outer hull was also reinforced with three centimeters of ablative armor, excepting areas where that was not possible (the undersides of the nacelles and the gangplank).</p>
        <p>The original Furry-class had eight chambers on deck two.  The fore-most was the computer control center, where the main computer core was located.  Immediately aft were the access stairway and the transporter room.  Next were four barracks rooms, each of which housed a dozen Crag boarding troops in poor conditions.  Aft of those were located two storage chambers for consumables and weapons for the boarding troops.  The Starfleet Refit Team decided that there was no need to house 48 boarding troops, and decided to convert those rooms into other facilities.  (See elsewhere in this file.)</p>

          <p>The computer system of the Furry-class ships was in all respects quite inferior to Starfleet computers of the same era. The hardware system was based on the old-style duotronic architecture, and the OS was little more than targeting scanners, life support control, and engine regulators. Some members of the Refit Team felt that the entire system should be completely scrapped and replaced with one of the new AI systems now being employed on several newer starships, but Accounting refused to spend the money to rewire the entire ship. Instead the Team settled for replacing the main computer core's hardware and software. The hardware was replaced with a DC-3 isolinear array computer system from Federation Micro Devices. It was not as advanced as the computer on the Sovereign-, Intrepid-, or even Galaxy-class ships, but given the Yub nub's smaller size it was adequate for the task. The Operating Software was custom built by the ever-friendly people at Nyetscape Communications. Although some members of the Refit Team still wanted Nyetscape to design a ROMANOV-based AI, budget restraints forced them to settle for a component-based, scalable system called Enhanced Waveform Object Kernel (EWOK). Written in the Cappuccino language, the EWOK system used the Starfleet-standard Multiple Access Jargonistic Enhanced Lexicon interface system (MAJEL) voice interface system, run from on-chip voice samplings. The final product was a stable, dependable, reliable computer system that had no fancy bells and whistles, but more than adequately handled the limited systems of the Yub nub.</p>
          <p>In addition to the interface, the Team also programmed the computer with most standard and non-standard maneuvering tactics. As the ship's primary defensive tactic was to dodge and run, it had to be able to do that very efficiently. The computer was given almost complete control of the basic maneuvering properties, and the Ops console on the bridge was rigged so that the Ops officer could give general commands, such as roll left or yaw right, and the computer would automatically translate those into appropriate impulse and thruster controls. This resulted in far more maneuverability and a far lower reaction time than could be accomplished by a human, or by a larger vessel with a larger inertial mass.</p>

        <p>The Furry-class was technologically inferior to standard Starfleet ships of its time in most respects, but one place where that was not the case was its warp propulsion system.  Utilizing eight matter and antimatter injector nozzles at each end of the horizontally mounted warp core in combination with reinforced magnetic generators in the Magnetic Constrictor Segments, the core was able to achieve a reaction efficiency not thought possible on a ship of its size.  In addition, Overlord technology included drastically improved matter-to-antimatter conversion systems, which allowed the ship to remain independent for longer periods as well as provide sufficient fuel for the warp system and the AMT.  The converter is configured to remain active almost constantly.</p>
        <p>The Yub nub has a cruising warp speed of warp 5.  Its maximum safe speed with the antimatter converter fully powered is warp 8.7, at which it can maintain a constant antimatter reserve level.  It can maintain a speed of warp 9.4 for a period of 12 hours before structural damage begins to occur.  Heavy use of the AMT, however, will result in depleted antimatter supply and subsequent reduction in warp capacity until the antimatter can be replenished.</p>

        <p>Maneuvering is achieved by means of unequal power distribution across the impulse grid.  Additionally, several quad-pack-maneuvering thrusters are located at various points around the exterior of the ship to provide extra maneuverability.  This unique combination allows the Yub nub to achieve far better sublight maneuverability than other vessels of its size, and in testing it was able to outmaneuver several Danube-class runabouts and Starfleet fighters.</p>

The refit process added three more Type VIII arrays to the Yub nub, one running the ventral length of the ship, and two on the dorsal side on either side of the weapons/sensor array.  The two dorsal phaser arrays extend over the back of the ship and curve inwards to cover the aft section as well.

          <p>The most intriguing system on the Furry-class was the charged anti-matter magnetic projectile system, more commonly known as the anti-matter torpedo (AMT).  The AMT worked by siphoning off anti-matter from the anti-matter storage compartment on decks two and three and channeling it to the dorsal weapons/sensor array located above deck one. There, the anti-matter (anti-deuterium) was stripped of its orbiting positrons and locked into a magnetic field generated by a magnetic constrictor.  The magnetic constrictor is a small device, only ten centimeters in diameter, which serves only to create and maintain a magnetic field capable of holding the charged anti-matter for a short period of time.  The constrictor was then propelled by the force of the stripped positrons, which were projected against a magnetic dish on the constrictor, out of one of the two forward- or one aft-facing AMT tubes at a target.  Each AMT tube had a firing radius of only 45 degrees, and once fired the projectile had no built-in propulsion or navigation systems. Upon contact with a target, the constrictor is destroyed by the impact and the anti-matter, now highly charged, is released against the target without having been diluted by deep space particles, the main drawback of an anti-matter spread as used by the Enterprise-D during the First Borg Incursion.  The charged anti-matter reacts with the target, causing a matter/anti-matter reaction which "eats up" the target in the reaction and releases huge amounts of energy in the process, causing further destruction.</p>
          <p>    The AMT system was left essentially untouched by the Refit Team.  Each of the three firing tubes is capable of launching 1 projectile every 1.8 seconds.  The two forward tubes can work in tandem, firing alternately with each other to release a projectile every .9 seconds.  Two tubes can not fire simultaneously, however, as soon as a projectile is launched another projectile can be readied for a different tube.  The AMT is not an effective weapon against energy-based shielding systems, as there is no matter with which to react.  It is, however, quite effective against any material defense, including starship hulls, starbase hulls, planetary installations, and even celestial bodies themselves.  This last target, that of a natural celestial body, was, to the best of Starfleet's knowledge, only used twice during the War. The first instance was against the Borg colony on Yavin, during the USS Montgomery's first contact with the Crag. The second was to destroy the primary satellite of Sith.  Sith is a world approximately 40 light-years from Crell, and is home to the Seetha, a reptilian race.  Sith's primary satellite, Xizor, was a major colony and production center, and the Crag, under Overlord control, destroyed it as a demonstration of what would happen to Sith if they did not surrender.  (A source of animosity between the two races ever since.)  In both instances, over 2000 ships were involved in a sustained, concerted attack.  While such an attack is still possible with the Yub nub, it would again require thousands of ships working in tandem for a sustained period of time, as well as a reason to do so.</p>
          <p>The Yub nub can store up to 500 magnetic constrictors.  A dedicated replicator in the weapons/sensor array can produce extra constrictors on demand and ready them for loading at a rate of 1 every five seconds.  Each projectile can be independently armed with anywhere from 1 gram to 100-kg equivalent mass of anti-matter.</p>

Four duty stations are present, two side aft and two side forward.  Originally, they were dedicated clockwise from the Conn to Engineering, Operations, Tactical, and Environmental, respectively.  The Yub nub refit included upgrading each station to be able to handle any function, although by tradition they are still assigned to that purpose.  Typically they are staffed by the Chief Engineer, Executive Officer, Chief Tactical Officer, and Chief Medical Officer, respectively, with the Chief Science Officer manning the Conn.  That is by no means fixed, however, especially as the crew are often elsewhere on the ship while on duty.  A high-resolution 3-meter gas plasma display at the fore of the bridge serves as a view screen.</p>

Three biobeds, one equipped with a surgical support frame (SSF), provide ample facilities for the crew of six.</p>

          <p>The port-middle barracks on Deck Two was converted for use as a communal galley.  The Furry-class was not equipped with replicators in each quarters, so rather than the expense of adding the requisite conduits the Refit Team opted to install two general purpose replicators on the fore-wall of this chamber and designate it the galley.  These replicators are capable of producing an adequate variety of foodstuffs for consumption, as well as small non-edible entertainment objects, energy levels permitting.  Two rectangular tables with seating for four each complete the facility.</p>

          <p>Holographic systems are limited to the single holosuite on Deck 2.  The refit team originally intended to forego any holographic recreational facilities due to energy constraints, but political pressure forced them to change their minds.  When they announced that holographic systems would not be included, the refit team was contacted by the Committee of Officers to Maintain Manageable Interactive Entertainment. COMMIE insisted that the crew of the Yub nub would have to have adequate recreational facilities or else they would call a subcommittee to consider the idea of striking on the Refit Line. Due to the shortage of space on the ship, the Refit Team replaced the starboard-fore Deck Two barracks with a generic Holosuite. Not as elaborate as a Holodeck, it did meet COMMIE's demands.  No other holographic systems are included.</p>

          <p>Immediately aft of the bridge is the lone weapons locker.  Although originally intended to hold enough munitions for three dozen Crag troops, peacetime operations and the reduced crew have reduced its usefulness.  Standard store is 10 type I phasers, 16 type II phasers, 10 type III phaser rifles, two dozen photon grenades, and eight energy-resistant vests.</p>

          <p>Given the vessel's small size, the original Furry-class designers did not see it necessary to go to the expense of including a turbolift.  Instead, a simple two-part staircase fore on the ship runs from deck one all the way to deck three.  During the refit, Starfleet decided that in order to better protect the ship from disaster the staircase should be sealable.  Therefore, three double-ply diamond-laced steel bulkheads were installed at the entryways, one on each deck.  The bulkheads can be closed on command from the crew, and automatically seal off all decks in case of hull breach.</p>

          <p>The six members of the command crew of the Furry-class were given private quarters on Deck 1, apart from the Crag troops on Deck 2.  Although the troops are no longer present, the six-person crew still has its quarters on Deck 1.  All six are single-room compartments containing a twin bed, nightstand, table, and couch or love seat. Quarters do not have private replicators.  The CO and XO are located aft most, closest to the Head.  </p>

          <p>Unlike Starfleet ships, the Overlords had built the Furry-class with full facilities, located in the aft section of deck one. It is suspected that the Overlords had not originally intended to provide this luxury for their Crag slaves, but as an Overlord was often present on a ship to maintain loyalty, they soon discovered that Crag, when not kept clean, begin to emit microscopic particulate matter into the air which produces a distinctive effluvia, as well as larger particles which settled on objects and trapped this effluvia to the surroundings. To avoid the drawbacks to efficiency produced by this dilemma, the Overlords provided a section of the ship for the Crag to rid themselves of this particulate matter in a non-offensive manner. The discovery of several dozen vessels left in permanent dry-dock at Starbase 202 which lacked this feature tends to confirm this hypothesis.</p>
          <p>The Furry- and Yub nub-class head is located at the aft section of deck one, with a single entrance from the main corridor. The rear wall of the chamber is curved to match the curvature of the ship itself, with a 1.5-meter gap between the outer wall and the inner wall. Two quarter-circle corridors occupy this space, with entrances at the fore sides of the room, which have liquid-hydrogen monoxide emitters in the ceiling and walls and waste collection slots at the sides of the floor, which is slanted inward. A subject enters one of these corridors at the fore-end and passes through the dihydrogen monoxide emitters, which remove 98% of the particulate matter given off by the Crag, as well as most other species. The subject then passes through another door at the back of the chamber into a smaller room two meters square. This room is equipped with high velocity gaseous projectors on all six walls, which enables the subject to remove the excess dihydrogen monoxide left over from the quarter-circle chambers in a minimum amount of time. This room then opens into the main chamber. Arranged around the back wall of the chamber are four triangular regions divided off from the rest of the chamber by thin steel plating, which extends approximately 3/4 of the way from the floor to the ceiling. These partitioned sections each contain a standard waste collection bin, with a hydrogen monoxide rinse. In the center of the chamber is a large pipe, one meter in diameter, which carries the anti-matter from the storage area below to the dorsal weapons array. Although some officers were concerned that this close proximity to the anti-matter would result in undue exposure to anti-proton radiation, the radiation levels in this chamber were found to be only .0002% higher than the average level throughout the ship. Around the anti-matter carrier pipe is a circular hygienic dihydrogen monoxide fount, which is activated by infrared sensors implanted in the carrier pipe.</p>
          <p>All waste material extracted by the facilities is channeled to the matter storage and replication generator on deck three for recycling.</p>

        <p>Though originally a ship of war, the upgraded Furry-class ships proved to be capable of peacetime operation as well.  It served as both an offensive ship, a defensive ship to protect stationary installations, escort vessel, patrol, scout, and distance exploration.  Although some medical personnel were concerned that a crew of only six would lead to psychological difficulties, none of the crews of the first six Yub nub vessels complained about the close quarters.  The first Yub nub in service was the USS Glowah in the Fourth Fleet, although others were later added to both the Fourth Fleet and the rest of Starfleet.  Standing in stark contrast to the larger, better powered, up-to-date Starfleet ships-of-the-line such as the Sovereign-class and the Trafalgar-class, the Yub nub proved that it wasn't the size of the ship that mattered, it was how fast it could move.</p>
