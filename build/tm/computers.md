The Sources {.title}
-----------

In order to clear up many conceptions, misconceptions, knowledge,
misknowledge, information, misinformation, and mister information that
people have about Star Trek computer systems, I offer the following
discussion of Star Trek computers, based on what we know of them from
the canonical sources. First, let's list a few of those sources,
specifically, several exerpts from the Star Trek Encyclopedia:

[ *Isolinear optical chip.*Sophisticated information storage and
processing device used aboard 24th-century starships. Composed of linear
memory crystal material, the isolinear chip came into general use around
2349, and was used for both information storage and data processing.
Within larger computing devices, isolinear chips are often housed i n
wall-mounted racks, permitting computer access to dozens, even hundreds
of chips at once time. ("The Naked Now" [TNG]). Isolinear chips replaced
older, less efficient duotronic enhancers aboard Federation starships
around 2329. [Description of one episode's events omitted.]]

[ *Linear memory crystal.*Optically refractive material used in
isolinear optical chips, a key part of optical data processing devices.
The sentient nanites accidentally developed by Wesley Crusher in 2366
consumed linear memory crystal as nourishment, enabling their
reproduction.]

[ *Bio-neural gel pack.*Component of a bio-neural computer system
consisting of a flexible, liquid-tight package containing synthetic
neural cells in [a] gelatinous organic medium. The gel packs were
designed for convenient management of bio-neural circuitry, and could be
easily swapped out as needed. The Starship Voyager initially carried 47
replacement gel packs in its inventory. Bio-neural processors were
vulnerable to viral and other infections, which could adversely affect
system performance. [Description of the VGR episode where that happened
omitted.]]

[ *Bio-neural circuitry.*Advanced computer technology using synthetic
neural cells for data processing. Bio-neural circuitry could organize
and process complex information faster and more efficiently than
traditional optical processors. The computer systems on the Starship
Voyager used bio-neural gel packs to supplement its optical data
network. ("Caretaker" [VGR]). In fact, the U.S.S. Voyager was the first
Federation starship to have bio-neural fibers incorporated into its
systems. ("State of Flux" [BGR]).]

Analysis {.title}
--------

The first thing I would like to highlight is that Voyager did NOT use a
bio-neural core, but used gel packs to supplement its traditional
optical data network. Presumably, gel packs were used in high-processing
systems where they would have the most impact. The fact that Voyager
carried only 47 spares also supports the argument that they didn't use
all that many of them.

The second thing to highlight is that isolinear chips are both
processing and storage devices. That is, they are the CPU and RAM and
Hard Disk all in one neat little package. The computer cores on the
Enterprise-D (we're now switching over to discussing chapter 4 of the
TNG Technical Manual, pages 49-53) are subspace-souped up clusters of
thousands of isolinear chips spanning several decks, arranged in access
to use racks. Each individual chip contains onboard nanoprocessors as
well as the ability to store "2.15 kiloquads per chip in standard
holographic format" [(TNG TM, page 53)]. When used in the main cores,
the core's "subspace flux" increases each chip's processing speed by as
much as 335%. (The overclocker's dream.)

380 quaditronic optical subprocessors are spread throughout the ship to
aid in processing tasks and increase redundancy, and to act as backup
for critical areas of the ship such as the bridge. What "quaditronic"
means is known only to the Paramount accounting department (where the
real creativity on the Star Trek set takes place). These subprocessors
are presumably collections of isolinear chips, just like the main cores.
All of the subprocessors and main cores are linked together through the
Optical Data Network (ODN).

Alright, so what the heck does that all mean? I'm not sure if any of you
are familiar with massive multi-processing, but in modern computers it
is possible to design computers that instead of having one or two CPUs
have hundreds or thousands of CPUs, all symmetrically multi-processing.
Aside from the raw speed and number-crunching power (Quake III Arena
must kick serious arse on such a machine), this also brings us into the
realm of massive multi-processing. I am not certain of the gory details,
but the basic way that we think about a computer changes when you get
into such large scale multi-processing. When you have, in essence,
hundreds of "binary brains" working together, funky things happen that
make the computer much more powerful (and confusing) than simply adding
up their combined megahertz would suggest.

Each isolinear chip contains one or more (the Tech Manual is unclear)
nanoprocessors, which are simply processors that are really small.
Presumably they are also several orders of magnitude faster than any
chip Intel has ever produced. If there are multiple in each, then each
chip is its own multiprocessing system. Now hook a few dozen of them
together and have them work symmetrically, and you have a massively
multi-processing bank. That's a subprocessor. Now hook a few thousand of
those banks together, and overclock them (the "subspace flux" generated
by the FTL elements in the main core) by over 300%. You now have a main
computer core, massively multi-massively multi-processing. (No, that's
not a typo.) Now connect 380 of these banks and three of these giant
cores, using fiber optic cable several zillion times faster than the
fiber trunks we have carrying data across the Pacific ocean. That's a
Galaxy-class computer. (And you thought the Internet was complicated.)

So where does bio-goo fit into all of this? The Encyclopedia says that
gel packs "supplement [the] optical data network." Presumably this means
they are used in the subprocessors that are distributed throughout the
ship, or possibly in place of the subprocessors, to handle highly
complex tasks which are better done using a mini-nervous system rather
than "traditional" isolinear/holographic processing.

It is never stated explicitly whether or not gel packs are capable of
data storage, a key ability of isolinear chips. If they are not, then
they can not be used to completely replace isolinear chips at all, as
the computer would have no storage mechanism. We are told that the
holodecks on an Intrepid-class starship use only isolinear systems (one
of the early episodes, second or third I believe), so that may in fact
be the case, although we cannot be certain. Although it is not suggested
in the manuals, I would hypothesize that, just as modern RISC chips are
fantastic at some tasks while CISC chips are far better for other tasks,
gel packs are not suited for every situation, but work best in certain
types of applications.

Conclusions {.title}
-----------

Where does that leave ship designers, then? I would submit, based upon
the preceding evidence the following guidelines:

-   A completely isolinear computer system is a perfectly acceptable way
    to run a starship.
-   Bio-neural circuitry can be used to supplement isolinear systems in
    appropriate locations and tasks by incorporating them into or using
    them to replace isolinear subprocessors.
-   A computer system cannot be 100% bio-neural. That involves the
    potential loss of data storage ability (although that is not
    assured, see above). In addition, it is logical to presume that if
    Voyager only carries 47 spare packs, and got worried when they
    started to run out (the episode where Voyager caught the flu), that
    isolinear chips are easier to manufacture, replace, and generally
    work with. Gel packs also make the doctor's job much harder when he
    has to give the computer sick leave because it is sneezing on the
    consoles.
-   Shuttles, runabouts, fighters, and other small craft probably do not
    need the added branching neural processing abilities of bio-neural
    circuitry.

As a side note, I recently read the book "The Computers of Star Trek" by
Lois Gresh & Robert Weinberg. My advise would be to save your money.
Although I have met Mr. Weinberg and go to school with his son, he
missed the mark completely with this book. It is page after page of
strawman arguments, that make me genuinely question if the authors
actually read the Tech Manual as they claim. Some of the statements
regarding modern security algorithms are interesting, but the rest of
the book is continued statements of why Trek computers suck, and are
backwards, and it doesn't matter because within 5 years we'll all have
so many nanochips implanted in our bodies that we will have become Borg
anyway. Don't bother, it's not worth your time.
