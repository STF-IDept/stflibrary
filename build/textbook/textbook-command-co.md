Introduction {.title}

"You may be the boss, but you're only as good as the people who work for
you."

—Rear Admiral William Leahy

Welcome to the Star-fleet Command Course for Commanding Officers (CO).
So you think you are ready for that big step. You have your eye on that
fabled centre chair and a command of your very own. Perhaps you are an
experienced Executive Officer (XO) and want to check your readiness.
Perhaps you are a fledgling CO just wanting to make sure you are
covering the basics. Or maybe you are an experienced CO wanting to
improve that little bit more. This course should have something for
everyone.

This course aims to break down the basics and to provide you with the
essential information that anyone needs to be a successful CO in any
environment. All areas will be covered from in character work to out of
character work. Make no mistake about it; this course will be one of the
most important learning experiences you will have in STF.

Unlike other courses, this course has two writers to give a wider
perspective on the most demanding position in the club. Fleet Captain
Sarah Hemenway will be giving the benefits of her experience as a CO on
several ships, including the USS Atlantis, USS Olympic and OP42, as well
as being an Academy XO on the USS Challenger. Sarah will be writing the
essential guide to the Administration side of being a CO, everything
from Message of the Day (MOTD) design and updating, to the Internet
Department (IDept) regulations you should be aware of.

Fleet Captain Symon Silvester has commanded the USS Vanguard, OEDV and
SS Bonaventure, will be providing a guide to the actual role of a CO and
what you should be doing to run your ship to the best of your ability.

What is a Commanding Officer (CO)? {.title}
----------------------------------

"Commanding Officer (CO): Also known as the old man, the captain of the
ship. The CO is ultimately responsible for everything that happens to
and aboard his/her ship. It has been said the captain of a sea-going
vessel is the closest thing to a god on earth."

—Rubbermice.com - 'Definitions of Commonly Used Nautical and Military
Terms'

Commanding Officer (CO)

The CO of an RPG Ship serves as the ship's Administrator and
In-Character commanding officer. A CO is appointed by Presidential
Edict, with the advise and consent of the Fleet Commander. A CO may be
removed by Presidential Edict. In addition to RPG duties, the CO is
responsible for ensuring that the crew stays active; managing personnel
and enforcing AWOL policies on the ship; ensuring that new members are
given adequate assistance as needed; maintaining the ship's MOTD;
optionally maintaining a Ship or Captain's Log; and further duties as
conferred upon the desire of the Fleet Commander, or established by
Edict. The CO is responsible for ensuring the completion of all his
duties, even if they are delegated to the XO.

The CO has the power to promote members of his crew up to and including
the rank of Lieutenant Commander. The CO may promote members of his crew
to the rank of Commander with the consent of the Fleet Commander, should
the Fleet Commander choose to exercise such authority. Other powers may
be specified by Edict or by the Fleet Commander.

No individual may hold more than one CO position simultaneously. The CO
of Academy Training Ships does not count towards this limit. Acting CO
does not count towards this limit.

—STF Definition of a Commanding Officer (CO). FCOMM, Herr \#22

The Commanding Officer (CO) is the role-playing head of a ship. Although
as a CO you have total authority over hiring and firing of personnel for
your ship and can run the ship your way, you are still responsible to
the chain of command for the condition of your ship. A CO has one simple
overall guiding principle that should always be remembered and that this
course will come back to time and again.

*"To maintain a healthy and active role-playing environment"*

As a CO it is your job to run an efficient and active ship. You manage
the resources available to it. You provide the direction for your ship
and your own actions will have direct effect on whether that environment
is a success or not. As a CO the authority is all yours, as is the
responsibility. If the ship is failing...there is often no need to look
past her CO for the cause.

You earned the right to have the position but you might find it more
difficult to keep it. Being a CO is the most challenging role in the
club and the most difficult to master. The pressure to keep the
environment active and healthy is an ongoing one. There is no let up;
the challenge and the pressure are continuous. A non active Commanding
Officer is dead wood.

What is a CO's Job In Character (IC) and Out of Character (OOC)? {.title}
----------------------------------------------------------------

The role of a CO is to be the head of a ship both In Character and Out
of Character. As such it is the most important role on the ship, but not
necessarily the most critical.

As a CO you will be responsible for making the decisions about your ship
both IC and OOC. OOC will include the recruitment of personnel to your
ship and the appointment of crewmembers to the key roles DH, XO and GM.
Each of those positions is critical to your ship...and if you get the
wrong person it can be difficult, or worse, detrimental to your vessel.

Take, for example, the role of GM. We have all seen the effect of a
truly awesome GM on a ship. They can inspire and interest the crew, keep
the roster active and make recruitment a dream. But a poor GM can also
destroy a ship, lose the players interest and cause the ship to drag
down. Who is responsible for appointing a GM? You are. Who needs to make
that decision to replace a GM that is performing poorly? You do. When do
you keep encouraging someone or replace them? Again it is down to you,
the Commanding Officer.

As the Commanding Officer it is your job to provide a clear direction
for your ship, an example in character and out of it. You should always
be focussing on that one statement. "To maintain a healthy and active
role-playing environment."

The In Character (IC) job of a CO can be characterised as being the eye
of a storm. Your crew will look to your for focus and direction; and you
must respond. You should be calm, authoritative and decisive. Doesn't
matter if the decision doesn't work out the way you hoped, at least you
tried something.

However what this means to you as a role-player is big change from all
the roles you have had before. The Commanding Officer is head of the
ship and it is tempting to be heroic and to show every one your skills.
However, that is not your job. Your role-playing skills are vital now
but not to solve the problem, rather to delegate the problem to your
crew. Your job now is to give orders that will keep the crew busy, often
far busier than the CO themselves.

Why? The answer is obvious. People are on your ship to role-play, so you
must give them tasks to be able to role-play. Do this by breaking up
your orders and giving them to your Executive Officer (XO) and
Department Heads (DH). It is tempting to try to leap in, but always
restrain that enthusiasm. On many ships the CO is nearly always in his
ready room, or sitting in the command chair, rather than being in on the
actual action. That is the way it should be. Your own pleasure and
enjoyment should be coming from seeing your whole crew active and
interested.

In character you have to give the orders, but also let your crew do
their job and don't try to overrule someone. After all you will have
been a DH once so don't interfere with how they do the task you have
assigned to them, unless you absolutely have to.

Listen to the IC advice from your Department Heads after all they are
experts in their fields. Also rely on the support and advice from your
XO. In Character and OOC the XO is your right hand.

Remember that your example IC and OOC is key on your ship. Your
behaviour sets the tone for your ship. Your IC posts must be of the
detail and nature that you wish your crew to follow. Laziness on your
part will be seen as a good example by your crew. Post regularly and
post well. You are a role model. If the CO doesn't seem interested in
their own ship and the sim then the crew will be the same.

OOC you are the main cause and continuation of any atmosphere that your
ship has. Aim to make your ship have a positive and friendly feel.
People will follow your example. If you reinforce good posting with
positive OOC comments your crew will be encouraged. Don't let OOC
comments get out of hand or they can take over the ship, but always
offer praise to your crew, even if only for everyone posting within the
last day. Encourage good performances and make your crew feel noticed
and wanted.

Similarly with negative OOC don't let it start on your ship and be quick
to end it. Take it to email and resolve it there.

So to summarise what are your powers?

### In Character (IC) Powers {.title}

#### Promote {.title}

You have the right to promote someone that you feel has earned it for
their in character actions. Promotions mean a lot to people as they care
about their characters. Even people whose club rank is much higher than
that of the character you are promoting can be pleased with it too. Just
remember promotions should be used to set an example for good in
character behaviour. Don't promote too often or the effect loses its'
worth too. Most CO's will leave promotions until after a sim is
completed as a reward for the participants who have shown the most
commitment through the sim.

Remember the following!

When someone is an Ensign in a particular field and passes an academy
course for that discipline, they are entitled to ask for a promotion for
their character to Lieutenant Junior Grade.

Promotions to Full Commander are subject to the whim of the Fleet
Commander. In many cases the Fleet Commander will only require notice of
said promotion. It is your responsibility to know before you promote
someone to the rank of Commander. If in doubt ask!

Although most promotions are done at the end of a sim, you can promote
during a sim. This is useful if you are promoting someone to a position
of authority, such as DH, and you are trying to show that they now have
the in character rank to separate them from their Junior Officers.

#### Discipline {.title}

Discipline can take many forms. Some characters might have committed
offences within the military code that they would be operating under.
Refusal to follow orders, disobeying orders and insubordination are all
common examples. Another STF role-playing favourite is the fight.
Characters everywhere love to have a fight, but this is an offence under
military codes of behaviour. As such as the CO you have to choose to
either turn a blind eye, or to punish.

##### Why would you choose to punish? {.title}

Every ship operates on a code of discipline and the actions IC of a
character can give an idea of what the CO is prepared to allow or to
tolerate. For example, two of your characters have a fight and you turn
a blind eye to it, effectively pretending IC it never happened. Other
members of the crew may think this looked fun and stage their own
fights. You have already set an example of ignoring one fight. Pretty
soon you could have a ship full of characters fighting and no way to put
a halt to it.

In character punishments for offences can often show people that
although it was good role-playing, characters must face consequences for
their actions. In this way you are setting a precedent for all
role-players on your ship and enforcing positive behaviour.

##### When would you turn a blind eye? {.title}

A CO should never, ever, play favourites. You shouldn't excuse someone's
character because you like the role-player or trust their role-playing.
You should always enforce standards equally.

There are, however, circumstances where you might decide it is
appropriate to ignore what a character just did. For example the
role-player controlling the character might be inexperienced. A gentle
chat to them by email might reveal that they didn't understand the
implications of their actions. Rather than draw attention to it you can
just ignore the post.

Maybe someone doesn't understand what the IC rules are. It is your job
as a CO to help them, rather than punish them.

##### What punishments are available? {.title}

In character punishments should fit the nature of the crime committed. A
case of insubordination could just be left to the XO or DH's to handle
by way of a dressing down to the individual's character. Repeated
insubordination should be treated more severely. Consider the
possibilities of confining the individual to quarters or similar
punishments.

There are many types of punishment. From the dressing down in private,
to assigning cleaning duties, to time in the in the brig and court
martial leading to demotion and/or dismissal from the service.

These punishments are open to any CO In Character. However, it is
advised that the CO makes sure that the role-players involved are okay
with the level of punishment. To suddenly threaten a player with court
martial or demotion could alienate the role-player.

Most experienced role-players will be aware of the nature of the
punishment they are likely to incur and in fact will be more than
willing to discuss punishments with you to fit in with where their
character story could go.

As a general rule, if you think a character needs to be punished, email
the person involved and explain that you although you appreciate their
characterisation, your character will need to punish their character as
a realistic response to their actions. Ask them what they think would be
suitable.

Finally, sometimes all a character needs is an in character dressing
down. However, remember the attachment people have for their characters.
Make sure that the role-player doesn't think you are dressing them down!
In character discipline should always be considered carefully.

#### Delegation/Assigning people {.title}

The temptation of all CO's is to try to be at the heart of the action or
everywhere at once. Sooner or later, regardless of time lines, you have
to realise that you must trust your crew.

In fact most of the time you will find your character spends most of
their time on the bridge or in the ready room. Your time as a hero is at
an end. It is your job to make sure that everyone has tasks to do.

As mentioned previously delegate tasks. This may be by breaking down a
mission task and assigning it to departments, or something as simple as
telling the XO to select an away team.

You are the CO and your authority is absolute. You can assign people to
roles as required. In character and out of character no-one expects you
to be perfect, but they will expect results. So make sure you make the
best use of your resources. Make sure IC and OOC the RIGHT people are in
the RIGHT roles. You can assign people to roles or tasks, you can
reassign them and you can remove them too.

The choice is yours. In character try to find characters with the right
skills and abilities, out of character try to make sure that everyone
gets a chance to shine.

##### When should I delegate? {.title}

When to do so will give other members of the crew tasks and allow them
to post creatively without endangering the progress of the sim.

##### When should I take charge? {.title}

Well as a CO you are always in charge, even if you aren't physically
there. What you should do is monitor a situation. If progress isn't
being made, such as several people are not posting, or no-one seems to
know what to do, it is okay to have your character check on progress.
This can be done via the communications badge as well as personal
visits.

##### Are there situations where I shouldn't delegate? {.title}

Use your common sense. Is the ship in immediate danger? Would you not
reacting and unifying the chain of command result in danger to the ship
and the crew? You are ultimately responsible for the ship and her crew.
You have to make the tough decisions, life and death decisions.

If the sim presents that the ship is under attack or in immediate danger
as CO you should be in command and in charge. That is your job.

STAR-FLEET EXPECTS THAT EVERY PERSON WILL DO THEIR DUTY

#### Command of the Ship {.title}

This might sound strange but you are in charge of the ship and the crew.
You can delegate the responsibility, but you are the person that gives
the direction, points the finger and says "Engage."

The crew can't make decisions for you. So tell them what to do. Order
your course, order your speed, fight your ship and fire your weapons. In
a crisis do you really want your ship being handled by someone else?

All that the crew of a star-ship really do is to make sure the thing is
working so when the Captain says go...it goes!

So make sure you develop that command persona. Imagine the examples from
the shows, Kirk, Janeway, Sisko, Picard and Archer. When they gave an
order it was obeyed without dispute. So be decisive! When you give an
order, it should be obeyed. Speak with authority and presence. You
earned your rank and your position. Star-fleet is a military
organisation with a military chain of command. Make sure you give the
direction both In Character and Out Of Character that your ship needs.

#### Ensuring the effective running of the Ship. {.title}

This is part of your In Character position. You are the person
ultimately in charge of the ship. Her performance reflects your own as
Captain.

Your XO is your right hand man. It is their job In Character to
encourage and monitor the effectiveness of the ship, but you should
always feel free to ask for status reports and performance drills. Why?
Because it is your ship and you should know how good your crew are and
what their performance will be like in a crisis.

You will rely on your XO but you must also monitor their performance
too, you should ask your XO how the ship is performing, encourage
improvements and never accept second best.

Ask for drills. You have a myriad to choose from including Fire Drills,
Damage Control Drills, Target Drills and Battle Stations. These are
always useful in sim dead time or when a particular department doesn't
have anything to do. Make sure you use these events well. Remember that
these events will constitute side sims and should not take the place of
the main sim.

Do not circumvent your XO. Work with and through your XO to create a
great In Character atmosphere and ship performance. Demonstrate your
trust in your first officer.

### Out of Character (OOC) Powers {.title}

#### Recruitment {.title}

This is one of the biggest aspects of any CO's life and is often one of
the most time consuming. It is rare that someone will just happen to
drop by your ship and offer to join. If they do it is a sign that your
roster is full and active, the sim interesting and that the ship is
moving in the right direction.

There is no real limit on the amount of people you can have on your
roster. Some CO's believe the more the better. Others are happier with
smaller rosters which are tight knit and active. The choice is yours.
What is important though is that the roster is active. Do not let
inactive role-players hold roles just on the off chance that they decide
to post once more. Try to find a solution with the role-player but in
the end the ship comes first.

There will be more details on roster keeping and cleaning later in this
course.

Most often you will have to approach people or advertise roles to
attract the right candidates for the positions you have. The first thing
you should bear in mind is making sure you know what you are looking for
in a position. Look at the role. Do you need someone experienced? Do you
need someone who posts daily? Would it be a role for a promising newbie?
Is experience in a similar role vital?

Make sure you know what you want to achieve. You can't sell a role to
someone unless you know what you want. Above all be prepared to be
rejected. Don't be discouraged by this. Most people will be genuinely
too busy and will be flattered. Some people might rearrange ships to
join you too. Recruitment is the life-blood of any ship from JO to DH to
XO. Don't be put off by a no, move onto the next candidate. It is better
to have someone who is genuinely keen on a role. That enthusiasm
translates into their posting and approach to your ship.

There are several sources for recruiting that you should look at. These
include:

 Referrals 
:   Look within your own ship. Ask other role-players if they know of
    anyone who should be or could be approached about joining. It is
    sometimes worthwhile considering posting an announcement about
    recruitment on ships as well, especially if you wish to invite
    internal applicants for positions. Consult your XO and get their
    opinion. It might well be that someone on the ship knows someone
    looking for another ship.

 Searching other ships 
:   Look at other ships you are on. Are there any role-players on those
    ships that catch your eye or that you think would be good additions
    to your ship? Do they match the criteria you set? Sometimes this is
    the best way to search for a candidate as you will see their
    role-playing first hand. Also look at other ships in your fleet and
    see who stands out for you.

 Advertising 
:   Try to get your ship name into the open so people can notice it and
    might approach you about joining. There are several methods of doing
    this. First, place a note on your own MOTD about what positions are
    open and how to get hold of you. Next approach your Fleet Commander
    about placing a message about recruitment on the Fleet MOTD. Most
    Fleets will have options for advertising open positions within your
    ship or will be open to placing a news item on the MOTD about it.
    Finally, speak to the Personnel Department. They have access to an
    advert on the opening main page for STF. If you supply them with the
    text for your advert they will happily spotlight your ship for you.

 Fleet Reports 
:   Fleet reports always contain sections based on spotlighting
    role-players who excelled that month. Read the fleet reports
    published in command each month and see which role-players are
    spotlighted the most. Take this opportunity to have a look at that
    role-player.

 Personnel Department (PDept) 
:   Your friendly neighbourhood Personnel Department are there to help
    place people and match your needs. Speak to them about what
    positions you have open and general recruitment issues. They will be
    happy to help you.

 IRC and Instant Messenger (IM) 
:   Sometimes the best recruitment is done via IM. The personal touch
    always works best with people. They feel valued and wanted, not to
    mention they can discuss the role with you directly. The official
    IRC channel \#star-fleet is always a good place to speak to people
    about positions. Remember to obey channel rules and be polite.

 Academy 
:   Speak to the Academy Commandant and ensure your ship is registered
    as one of the ships to take the new graduates. Always liaise with
    the Commandant or Vice-Commandant. Never approach cadets directly
    about recruitment. This is a direct breach of rules. If a cadet
    approaches you about joining your ship, you must refer the matter to
    the Commandant.

Always back up an offer with an official email this will make sure there
is no miscommunication. Remember how you do your recruitment is down to
you, but the responsibility is yours. No-one is going to do your
recruitment for you. Be proactive!

#### Specialist Recruiting {.title}

Specialist recruiting is where you are searching for someone to fill the
two key roles on any ship; those of your Executive Officer (XO) and the
Gamesmaster (GM).

In recruiting an XO you must make a decision whether to appoint someone
with experience or to give someone a chance. There are several things to
look at. Do you feel you would benefit from having an experienced XO as
your second in command? Will it help you in settling into your role?
Does your ship need the experienced leadership? With an inexperienced XO
do you think you are ready to train someone in their duties? Can you
teach them what they need to know? Will they be able to make a
difference to your ship?

Selecting an XO means choosing someone to be your right hand person; you
must be able to form a bond of trust with that person. Trust them to do
their job and to give you support in doing yours. Make sure you choose
wisely and take care in your selection. It is worth seeking opinions on
a prospective candidate and taking time to make sure you are happy.

When appointing an XO ensure you are both clear on your expectations and
the shared duties before the appointment is made.

Selecting a GM for a ship is just as important. It is important to
consult with the Gamesmaster Department (GMD). They will have a list of
active GMs and a list of those GMs who are looking for additional work.
When choosing a GM it is worth looking up their previous missions and
speaking to former CO's. Perhaps you might also have experience of that
GM from your time on another ship. Make sure you are happy with their
style.

Just with appointing an XO, there are options to appoint an experienced
GM or a GM Trainee (GMT). Make sure you consider the possibilities well.
The GMD will always be there to give you support and a GMT will come
with a Mentor to keep them on track.

Think about whether you have specific requirements from your next sim.
Some sims will concentrate on certain departments more than others. Work
out what you would want from your next sim. It is important that you
pass these stipulations onto a prospective GM so they can make sure they
can fill them. Every GM will have their own style and preferred types of
sim.

A GM is the heart and soul of your ship. You must be able to trust them
to post regularly, keep your crew entertained and to be reliable. Take
your time, seek opinions and make sure you choose wisely for you and
your ship.

#### Appointing/Removing People from Positions {.title}

As CO it is your choice to make changes to your roster or not. Perhaps
someone has left your ship and you want to appoint someone to the role.
Well, it is for you to decide if you want to give someone else on your
ships, perhaps a JO, a chance in that role; or if you intend to appoint
someone from outside your ship.

There are pitfalls with either scenario. If you appoint from within the
ship will the person be able to handle the step up to the position. Will
you just create a new problem for yourself? Are there multiple
candidates for the role? Will that just create resentment from the other
applicants?

If you appoint from outside the ship will your current crew feel
overlooked? Will they feel you have given them a fair chance?

You will often not know if these problems have occurred so good
communication is always the key. Always explain your selection choices
positively to all candidates.

As well as appointing people there is also the prospect of removing
someone from a position. The most obvious case for this is when some one
is AWOL and shows no signs of coming back or hasn't responded to your
emails. This is permissible and you should act to keep your roster clean
and active. There are more details on roster cleaning and AWOL's later
in the course.

The other reason to remove someone from their position is for poor
performance. Poor performance can take many forms and it is for you to
judge what you think is the correct level of performance you would
expect from someone in that role. Always bear in mind that that person
may well not know that they are doing anything wrong.

Strong communication is the key. Talk to the person concerned and help
them. Explain what you want, offer support and training. Removing
someone should always be a last resort. However, in the end you may have
to act and remove someone from a position. This should be done after
discussions with them. It may well be they will agree with your reasons
or that they may choose to leave the ship. This is one of those hard
decisions every CO must make at some stage.

You are responsible for your roster and the performance of your crew.
From your XO to the lowest JO you are responsible. No-one else on the
ship has the authority to make those decisions. In the end you must make
the right decision for your ship.

#### Working with your GM {.title}

A GM's focus will be on providing a main sim for a ship, but most GM's
are pretty flexible. If you have feedback you should provide it to the
GM. Be positive in your approach.

Communicate any needs you think the ship has. If you feel that a
particular department or individual is not being included in the sim you
should be proactive and communicate this to the GM. Work with your GM in
arranging to keep your crew busy. Discuss potential side sims before
implementing them. Never just create a side sim and then dump it onto
the GM to handle. That is unfair.

Ask the GM for their feedback. It may well be that the GM needs help to
push the crew in a particular direction Work with your GM to ensure that
the main sim pushes forward. GM's suffer from problems as much as any
role-player and you should always ensure that your GM is happy in their
position.

It is also important that you have good communications with your GM
about areas such as LOAs. Your GM should be informed if you are planning
on a LOA. It might well be something that can be worked into the sim and
the GM can cover for your absence. You should also make sure that you
know when your GM is going on LOA. You should ask for sim notes and be
prepared to cover the sim yourself until the GM has come back. If the
absence is to be for a long term and you are reluctant to GM, approach
the GMD about acquiring a temporary GM.

A missing GM or one not posting regularly can disrupt a ship. Make sure
you work with your GM to avoid this.

Chain of Command {.title}
----------------

What is the Chain of Command? Well in any organisation there is a
structure. In STF we operate an In Character and Out of Character Chain
of Command based on the positions we occupy.

### In Character {.title}

In character on a ship a JO should report to a DH, that DH should report
to the XO, the XO to the CO and the CO to Starfleet Command. The Chain
of Command operates as a two way filter. Orders filter down and
information filters upwards. The DH is the first step in the link and
they will pass the information up to the XO. The XO effectively then
filters the information from the DH's decides what is important to pass
onto the Captain and does so. In Character it should be rare that the XO
cannot handle all but the most serious of problems before involving the
Commanding Officer. As CO you will manage the ship and report on her
effectiveness to Star-fleet Command. You will receive your orders from
them and report on your mission progress to Command.

### Out of Character {.title}

There is a clear chain of command for OOC work in STF too. Technically
it follows much the same process as the In Character chain of command.
Your JO's and DH's will report to the XO. Both the GM and XO will report
to you. Sometimes a person lower down the chain might circumvent the XO
and report to you directly. This is an activity you should discourage.
Ask to be copied in on all communication concerning your ship where
possible.

As a CO in a fleet you are responsible for your own ship and its'
performance. You will report to your Fleet Commander (FComm) and the
Assistant Fleet Commander (AFComm). You should seek support and advice
from your Fleet Commander. They are there to help you and your ship. The
Fleet Commander will report to the President ultimately. Make sure you
utilise this resource. Don't feel that you are alone in your problems.

You won't get in trouble for using the chain of command. Establishing
good communications is essential.

### Fleet Reports {.title}

One thing you will get used to is admin requirements of being a CO.
Fleet Reports are mandatory and there is no reason not to submit your
reports. These reports will inform those above you in the chain of
command as to your progress and that of your ship. They are vital and
must be completed. There are three reports required from your ship in
total, one from the CO, one from the XO and one from the GM. Remind your
command staff. A lack of reports reflects badly on your ship and
therefore on you!

### Conflict Management {.title}

There are times when people just don't get on. You will find someone is
complaining or has an issue. Sometimes by the time that the issue gets
to you it will be quite heated. Tempers can fray and people can get very
upset.

Make sure that you stay calm and collected. Think about the following
stages:

 Acknowledge the complaint 
:   Make sure you respond to the person sending the email saying that
    you have received the information and are looking into it. If
    someone tries to complain to you via IM, always ask them to send an
    email with the details in for official purposes. This is your
    record. Don't commit to the complaint or agree with it. You must
    remain impartial. Agree to look into the matter further and, if
    possible, give a date when you will be back in touch with an update.
    Explain the situation if there is going to be a delay. Be polite, be
    clear and be understanding. Never agree with the problem until you
    have looked into the matter further. Remember to tell the person not
    to discuss this matter on the ship.

 Assess the problem 
:   Is this an issue you can really deal with yourself? Can you make a
    judgment or a decision? Is this something simple or is this complex?
    Is this just miscommunication? Take your time; don't run into a
    hasty decision. Discuss the problem with your XO and get their
    input. They may have some a different view point or information.
    Finally, always feel free to approach the FComm for further advice.
    Remember to safe guard your evidence chain. This may be important
    later.

 Investigate 
:   Contact the other participants in the problem, if required. Always
    be polite and be professional. Remember you could be dealing with
    hurt feelings or people who did not even know there was an issue.
    Try to get their side of the story and any supporting evidence. Be
    patient and be understanding. Remember what one person sees as an
    insult another might take as a compliment. Once more remind the
    participants that they should not discuss this matter on the ship.

 Assess the evidence 
:   Look at the evidence. Can you see what the cause of the problem is?
    Sometimes it can be something really small and simple that has hurt
    feelings. Never belittle the complaint. Always ask for discretion
    when discussing evidence with your XO or the FComm. It will do
    no-one any good to have rumours starting. If you need to send your
    evidence on this is when you need to make sure you have all the
    emails and logs you will require.

 Making a decision 
:   With the help of the previous four points and discussions you should
    be in a position to understand the problem and its cause. With this
    information you must make the decision as to whether you can handle
    this problem yourself or the problem should be handed upwards for
    the FComm to officially review. Remember to be calm, courteous,
    understanding and impartial. Your decision must be the best for the
    ship. Your personal feelings must not enter into this situation. 95%
    of all conflicts can be resolved at your level with no more than
    some sympathy and understanding. It is rare a conflict will become
    more, but in the end you have the authority to remove someone from
    the ship. Although not a move you should consider lightly, it is a
    power a CO has.

You are the CO. You are responsible for your ship and the happiness of
your crew. Never ignore problems as they will only grow and become
serious issues. Worse someone may think you don't care.

Remember the following. Listen. Understand. Be Fair. Be Decisive.

The Essential Guide to Administration! {.title}
--------------------------------------

Get used to it! Being a CO requires dedication and time. There is a lot
of hard work behind the glamour that you cannot escape. There is plenty
of administration that needs to be done. Fleet Captain Sarah Hemenway
outlines the essential areas of a CO's admin work below.

### Roster Keeping and Cleaning {.title}

The golden rule when it comes to your roster is to keep it clean. This
helps the Personnel Department assign new members to your ship, but it
also helps your crew know who is active and who isn't. An unsightly
roster reflects on you and your ship. You can have characters that are
both rostered and non-rostered (where the character is not on the roster
itself, but accessed via the player's drop down menu when they post).
This allows you to remove AWOL players or eLOA ones without losing their
character information. More details about AWOLs are provided in the
section below and more information about the Administrative Menu is
provided in another Academy course.

### Enforcing Posting Requirements (AWOLs) {.title}

Every fleet in STF has a designated AWOL policy, set by the Fleet
Commander. This will be displayed on the Fleet Message of the Day
(MOTD). This applies to all ships in the fleet, unless prior
authorization from the FComm has been received. If you feel that the
AWOL policy is wrong for your ship, drop your FComm an e-mail to explain
the situation; they might be willing to allow you to set your own.
Things to consider when you review your AWOL policy are is it too fast
or too slow? Is your crew posting daily? Are people struggling to post
regularly within the AWOL limits?

Standard AWOL limits are as follows. Posting within 3 days of your last
post on a ship for CO, XO and GM. Posting within 5 days of their last
post on a ship for DHs. Posting within 7 days of their last post on the
ship for JOs. Exceeding these limits means that someone is AWOL.

Unfortunately, what comes along with posting requirements is actually
enforcing them. This is one of those items that you might delegate to
another member of your command staff; such as your XO. Make sure that
you explain what you expect and that you are copied in on any AWOL email
they send.

It is a common courtesy to e-mail someone once they have exceeded AWOL
limits but a few days before you intend to remove them from the roster.
This e-mail should not be threatening in nature at all, but rather serve
as a pleasant reminder that the ship misses them. You might also want to
include a date (a few days in the future) on which you intend to AWOL
them if you don't see a post or a response to the e-mail.

In the ship Admin Menu there is an AWOL feature that allows you to take
a role-player off the roster but not to lose their details completely.
This is explained fully in the Academy Administrative Menu course, which
is also located in the Academy Textbook.

Once in a while, someone will return after going AWOL. Do you have to
let them back on? It's up to you. Make sure to consider all aspects of
the situation before allowing or disallowing a member to return. You
should consider how often the player has been AWOL; is this their first
time or have they done this before? Is the role that they are filling
crucial to the ship and the sim? Can you continue with their absence?

Remember AWOLing can create disagreements, especially if someone is
removed from a position and returns later to find it has been filled.
Make sure that you handle these situations carefully and politely.
Remember that if you have delegated the AWOLing you should handle any
disagreements that result.

### Welcoming New Members {.title}

New members can either be the best part of the ship or the worst. The
end result is very much dependent on the welcome and support that a new
member receives upon joining a ship. The Personnel Department provides a
number of different resources to brand new members; however, one of the
most direct influences is you. Longer serving members will have more
experience.

Anyone joining your ship should receive a welcome e-mail from either you
or your XO (or both). Just take a moment to introduce yourself, maybe
elaborate on what opportunities you've had in STF, and definitely
include your contact information, so that the member can get help if he
needs it. You might also want to consider explaining the posting
requirements of the ship and a little about the current mission. Explain
anything unique to your ship or that will be of interest to that person.
Despite all of this, be careful not to make it too long; you don't want
to intimidate a new member (or they won't even read it!). Always ask for
a reply to your email, just to make sure they received it.

Welcoming someone on the ship in an OOC note is a great way to make them
feel part of your ship. Also think about IC ways to meet them or help
them fit in. Don't ignore them!

### Player Characters {.title}

As a CO, you do have control over what kind of characters you want on
your ship. The FCOMM Edict outlines what character races are expressly
forbidden in STF, but it is up to you to approve the characters you
accept onto your ship. While you don't want to inhibit the creativity of
your players, you do want to make sure that it's a fair environment for
everyone. Most players should have characters that are Federation races.
This means no Romulans or Cardassians, unless there's a very good back
story. Make sure that you ask the candidate to explain their character
background. If you have reservations you should address these at this
stage.

A background might appear very realistic but it is usually very rare, or
well played. Oh, and absolutely no Q! You also want to make sure that
your players are being realistic with their characters' abilities. If
you notice a player that's "stealing the show" with his super character,
you might want to drop him an e-mail explaining how this creates a
problem with the ship environment.

People become very attached to their characters and very possessive, so
you have to be diplomatic with your comments to an individual. Make sure
when you consider the application that you consider how that person's
character will fit in on your ship. For example if the character is of a
Klingon Warrior, how will that fit in on a science vessel?

Always feel free to ask a player for a bio. Most serious role-players
will create something and be open to questions.

Just remember, by accepting someone onto your ship you have tacitly
accepted their character and the consequences that might cause for your
GM and the rest of your crew. Make sure you are sure before bringing
someone aboard.

*REMEMBER: As a CO, you MUST know what races are allowed or not. You are
advised to read the FCOMM edict, which can be found
[here](http://www.star-fleet.com/library/bookshelf/charters/charter-fleets.html).*

### MOTD Updating {.title}

The very first thing a person sees when navigating to your ship is the
Message of the Day (MOTD). It's very important to have a MOTD that loads
quickly, presents information in a clean, crisp manner, and is short.
The latter is significant because all the buttons to post are way down
at the bottom of the screen; don't be cruel and make your crew break
their scroll fingers! If you're not familiar with HTML, the Internet
Department can help with their Frequently Asked Questions list. You can
also find more information about policies and how to create your own new
MOTD there. The department even provides some templates if you don't
know where to begin! There is always a strong community of people who
will happily help you create that MOTD you want. Ask around! See other
MOTD's that you like and find out who did them.

Your MOTD is your way of selling your ship and creating that unique
atmosphere. It is vital your MOTD contains the important information
about your ship, like what positions you have open, a sim update and
your AWOL policy. This is the first step in giving your ship an
identity! Just remember it says a lot about you. The same way not
keeping it up to date creates an impression too. Always try to keep your
MOTD and your Captain's Log up to date! These are important tools; use
them!

Good graphics on a ship are always attractive, but make sure that they
are not copyrighted and that they don't slow the loading of your MOTD.
The Internet Department (IDept) has formats for uploading images and
naming files. Make sure you follow these rules when it comes to your
MOTD.

Remember your MOTD is your responsibility. The IDept will police the
club to make sure that it breaks no rules but otherwise the layout,
design and updating are all yours. Use this tool wisely.

### External Ship Resources {.title}

Many COs want to collect some information about their ship, whether it
is the history, character biographies, or just some general ship-related
specifics. STF allows you a place to put all this information: a ship
web site. Every ship has a site. The format of the URL for the site is
http://www.star-fleet.com/stfX/shipname/, where X is the fleet number
and ship name is the FULL name of the ship. For example the OEDV website
is <http://www.star-fleet.com/stf6/oedv/>

More information about what you can put on the web site can be found in
the Internet Department. Please make sure that you read these policies,
as you are accountable for knowing them. You are responsible for
maintaining this site, although you can delegate the responsibility to
any member of the club. You will have to give permission for that
individual to upload changes to the Internet Department (IDept).

An external website gives your ship an advantage and can really sell
your role-playing environment to potential applicants. It is an
advertising tool but can also help new crew visualize your environment,
what makes you unique. It can also be used to store crew bios and show
the history of your ship. Make the most of these potential resources.

### Fleet Reports {.title}

So important, it features twice!

Every Fleet Commander is required to file a monthly report regarding the
status of his or her fleet. Often, this includes reports from the ship's
command staff, including the CO. The format for these reports varies
depending on the fleet, but there are a few items you should keep in
mind to provide a good report:

-   Did anything out of the ordinary happen this month? You should
    include things here like in character conflicts that may have gotten
    out of hand, et cetera.

-   Is the ship posting like it normally does? Is it faster or slower
    than normal? Can you pin-point why?

-   Have any crew members done a particularly great job this month? Do
    any of them deserve a higher position than the one they have now?

Every Fleet Commander that we've worked with would love to get reports
this detailed. Remember, the FComm can't help you and your ship if they
don't know what's going on; help them help you! Also, remember to think
about what you're writing and take it to heart; this is a time to
reflect on your ship in the past month and see what changes what need to
be made (or what needs to remain the same!).

Finally remember that these reports are seen in public. So make sure
those that deserve praise get it! Everyone likes a pat on the back. Make
sure that any criticism is made in private. No-one needs likes to be
criticized in public. Talk about general situations but don't point
fingers!

    the crew and don't post regularly. Explain how you would address
    these issues and how you pursue this matter.

2.  You are the Commanding Officer of the USS Nelson, a Pendragon Class
    Battle Cruiser. You have arrive at your destination planet where
    there is a deadly plague sweeping the planet below and threatening
    to kill all life. There is panic on the planet and many citizens are
    trying to flee. Star-fleet has ordered you to blockade the planet to
    control the spread of the contagion to other planets. You are asked
    by the planet government to help and send an away team. You are in
    the briefing room with your senior staff, all your Department Heads
