Introduction
============

Welcome to the star-fleet.com Security Academy course. Whether you've
never even seen a phaser or you've fought in more combat actions than
Sherman, this course is for you. It is designed to introduce you to all
aspects of Security, both In Character and Out Of Character, and more
importantly how to conduct combat operations within the STF framework.
Additionally it will give you a brief rundown of the weapons and
equipment available to a Starfleet Security Officer.

My name is Andrew Robinson and I joined STF In October 2004. Since then
I've held the position of Chief Of Security for Outpost 42, The U.S.S
Genesis, and the Scottie Testing Centre, three distinct environments in
which to experience the same position.

What Is A Security Officer
==========================

So how do you go about playing a Security Officer successfully? Well the
answer to that question lies in explaining what exactly a Security
Officer is.

A Security Officer is Diplomat, Policeman, Warrior and Peace Keeper. It
is not the job of Starfleet Security to romp about the galaxy blowing
the enemies of justice to hell. It is *vital* that you remember that the
primary role of the Security Officer is preventative in 99% of cases. If
it comes to combat you've likely done something wrong somewhere.

The particular stations that each individual officer will hold are
largely dependant upon the environment in which they are stationed:

-   *Starbases*: Starbase Security Officers are the true Policemen of
    the trade, spending virtually all of their time patrolling sectors,
    handling the mundane matters of Security Administration and
    preventing or investigating crimes, both big and small. Obviously on
    a station such as Starbase 1 you will have virtually no crime at
    all, and you'll spend most of your time looking pretty and standing
    still. However on the frontier outposts such as Outpost 42 in Fleet
    3, Outpost 45 in Fleet 2 and OED V in Fleet 6 you are distinctly
    more likely to come across crime. You'll even spend time creating
    some of your own arrests, particularly during character development
    stages. Having served as Chief Of Security for Outpost 42 myself I
    can assure you its certainly interesting work for a Security Officer
    to undertake.

-   *Science Vessels*: I'll warn you now that serving aboard a Science
    Vessel can be damnably boring work, and it takes a special kind of
    player to be able to successfully portray a Security Officer on a
    vessel like this. You will spend the majority of your time, even
    during a sim, writing posts that show you training, performing
    various mundane tasks such as patrolling areas, standing guard,
    performing Brig duty and running emergency action drills. A science
    vessel post isn't for everyone, and when the action does arrive, as
    it inevitably will once the weenies have had their fun you'll need
    to be prepared to handle whatever your de Sade wannabe GM may throw
    at you. Science vessel Security Officers will be given the
    opportunity to really exercise their diplomatic muscles,
    particularly when it comes to missions involving other cultures
    where you will be expected to guard your shipmates whilst not
    offending your hosts.

-   *Combat Vessels*: There has been a lot of debate as to the inclusion
    of combat vessels in STF, but I think anyone who has ever served on
    one will agree, they are quite possibly the most fun you can have
    with your clothes on. Combat Vessel Security Officers will have
    access to the best equipment, the best armour and weapons that
    Starfleet can provide, because nine times out of ten they'll need to
    use them. Frontline vessels such as the Draco in Fleet 5, the
    Atlantis in Fleet 3, the Endeavour in Fleet 5, and others will
    almost always receive combat related sims. But! And there is
    certainly a But here, this is actually not necessarily the kind of
    ship on which you spend your time firing phasers and hitting the
    dirt with photon mortars. You will spend your time on a Combat
    Vessel carefully balancing your innate desires as keepers of the
    peace against the potential combat situations in which you will find
    yourself.

What Does A Security Officer Know?
==================================

I have to say, I've seen it all when it comes to Security Characters:
some that will make your sides split with their eccentric ways, some
that make you pull your hair out in frustration, and some that are just
damn peculiar.

Security is the single biggest position in STF that receives its share
of nut cases. It seems to be very hard for people to create Security
characters that aren't all powerful with a mastery of every single
martial art that ever existed, perfect aim with a phaser and the ability
to carry nine wounded comrades thirty miles to an evac. point. Believe
me on this, I'm not kidding, I've seen it done.

When you create your character bear in mind the following as you write
your backstory:

-   Once a cadet enters Starfleet Academy they will spend two years
    learning the general studies that every officer in Starfleet is
    familiar with, including the basics of each field (Engineering,
    Security, Science and Medical), which will get each of them up to an
    equal standard of learning. Towards the end of the second year a
    cadet will be asked to choose their field. All fields within
    Starfleet fall under one of the four major groups; Engineering,
    Science, Medical and Security. For the remaining two years in the
    Academy each cadet will receive advanced training in the discipline
    of their choice.

-   What you need to remember is that during those last two years a
    Cadet will focus on Security and Security only, so whilst it's
    permitted in the Academy to minor in an unrelated topic it would be
    almost impossible to find a Security Officer with a minor in Medical
    Nanotechnology. When you create your character you must think
    carefully about what you want them to know.

-   Contrary to popular belief, the standard Starfleet martial art is
    not in fact the Klingon art of Mok'Bara, which was something that
    Worf taught the officers and crew of the Enterprise. The Martial Art
    taught in the Academy draws upon a wide range of styles from Earth
    and other cultures brought together in the 24th century style of
    anbo-jytsu/anbo jyutsu, the ultimate way of the staff. More
    information on this can be found through Google.

-   The Security Officer, dependant upon their final field, will be
    required to learn advanced tactics and weaponry, small ship
    piloting, anti terrorist tactics, small combat unit combat
    practices, Starship weaponry and tactics, as well as military
    history and field practices which include semesters covering basic
    combat triage, weapon maintenance and repair and survival. This is
    by no means a definitive list, and no Security Officer will know all
    of these backwards, forwards and inside out. There will be a general
    smattering of knowledge, but some of these are more particular to
    Marines and Intelligence Officers.

Weapons
=======

Introduction
------------

We now move on to the section that tends to hold peoples interest
significantly more than the others. It's worth noting that whilst you
will likely refer back to this weapons list you will probably never use
any weapons IC beyond those listed in the hand weapons section.

There are a number of weapons in use in Starfleet, some that have been
almost fully explained down to full technical specifications and some
that have been given only passing reference.

Always bear in mind that the standard equipment issued to any Security
Officer are tricorder and type II phaser, and most vessels carry nothing
larger than compression phaser rifles. Combat oriented vessels will
obviously carry larger and more varied stocks, but the chances of you
being issued with Armour and photon mortars are minimal to say the
least.

It's also worth mentioning that whilst your Character might have a
lovely collection of antique weaponry from dozens of cultures including
sniper rifles, Bat'Leth's Mek'Leth's and dozens of other nifty little
trinkets, you will \*never\* get to wear them or use them except in some
pretty damned extreme situations. It makes good character backstory for
a Security Officer to have a collection such as that, but you're a
Starfleet Officer not a Klingon warrior. NOTE: This doesn't preclude you
indulging in Worf's happy pastime of practicing with these weapons on
the holodeck. It makes for some rather excellent posting threads.

Hand
----

Type 1f Personal Phaser
:   This weapon has 4 settings. The Type If, due to its extra power
    availability provided by a slightly larger Sarium Krellide power
    cell, is the standard 'back up' sidearm for Starfleet Security
    personnel, including the Marines. This weapon is issued to away
    teams when having weapons visible could be detrimental to the
    mission. This weapon has an additional Sarium Krellide power cell
    embedded into the centre section giving it the ability to function
    for longer periods than the older type 1e. As with any sidearm, the
    main four beam types are Stun, Heat, Heavy Stun and Disrupt. This
    weapon is often treated as a covert weapon, and many officers over
    the years have decided that it is fun to stick one in their boot. It
    is fun until the phaser goes off and they end up in sickbay.
    Remember weapons handling and training is the Star-fleet way : Just
    like the modern military.

Type II Personal Phaser
:   This weapon has 16 Individual settings, each controlling the amount
    of damage capable of being inflicted to a greater degree than the
    type 1f. The Type II Phaser is the standard issue weapon for any
    away team and can be augmented with extra power cells should the
    need arise.

Type IIIa Phaser Rifle
:   When Starfleet Security or away teams need more firepower than a
    side arm they turn to the Phaser rifle. The Type-III is
    significantly more powerful than the Type II Phaser, in fact being
    little more than a power booster, though incorporating one or two
    extras. The Type III includes an effective targeting system and is
    equipped with a gyro-stabilized targeting unit. This targeting unit
    incorporates sensors capable of detecting and tracking life forms.
    The Type III has been phased out in recent years and has been
    relegated to an Academy training aid. Academy Starships carry a
    small supply of these aboard, usually stored aboard small auxiliary
    craft and in auxiliary weapon lockers.

:   *Power*: Enlarged Sarium Krellide power cell

:   *Power consumption*: 325 watts per shot

:   *Casing*: Tritanium Outer Shell

:   *Effective Range*: 400 m

:   *Settings*: 16 Variable Power

Type IIIb Phaser Rifle
:   Following first contact with the Borg a Starfleet Borg Tactical
    Analysis Unit was established at Starbase 324 and one of its first
    creations was the Type IIIb rifle. Utilising an advanced computer
    control matrix it was the first weapon specifically designed to
    rotate its power frequencies to combat the Borg. Since the advent of
    pulse compression and isometric technology this weapon has been
    phased out of active service and is rarely seen outside of a museum.

:   *Power*: Enlarged Sarium Krellide power cell.

:   *Power consumption*: 350 watts per shot

:   *Casing*: Tritanium Outer Shell

:   *Effective Range*: 500 m

:   *Settings*: 16

Type IIIc Pulse Compression Phaser Rifle
:   The current primary weapon in active Starfleet service, the Type
    IIIc uses pulse compression technology in conjunction with plasma
    accelerator systems to project toroidal plasma bursts at a
    significantly faster muzzle velocity than previous weapons. This
    allows significant increases in power level, facilitating greater
    frequency modulation capabilities. Pulse Compression rifles utilise
    biometric control systems and advanced targeting sensor systems
    capable of tracking and firing through solid objects. This rifle is
    a perfect multi purpose weapon that presents the first sustained
    fire pulse weapon in Starfleet's arsenal since the Plasma rifles of
    the early 22nd Century.

TR-116 Projectile Rifle
:   An experimental weapon developed by Starfleet Security, it fires
    tritanium projectiles propelled by expanding gases from a chemical
    detonation. This rifle was designed for use in areas of high
    electromagnetic (EM) interference (whether artificial or natural)
    that would render phasers useless, and as a potential alternative to
    energy weapons whilst engaging in combat with the Borg. The Weapon
    was never mass produced and became little more than a collector's
    item with no practical purpose that could be justified sufficiently
    for large scale production. One unique aspect of this weapon is its
    Exographic Targeting System, a separate sighting device which
    communicates with the weapon via a subspace transceiver link. The
    operator wears a wire frame helmet with a monocle attached over one
    eye, and moves a trackball (mounted on both sides of the weapon,
    making it ambidextrous) located on the rifle to zoom in to the
    target. The magazine is contained in the forward handgrip under the
    barrel, being removed by releasing a catch aft of the trigger guard
    and sliding it forward. In 2375, one of these rifles was modified on
    Deep Space Nine with a micro-transporter connected near the barrel
    exit. The rifle dematerialized the bullet after firing and
    rematerialized it just in front of the target, and could possibly
    have done it inside the victim. The person responsible, a
    traumatized Vulcan officer, murdered several Starfleet personnel
    before being wounded by another modified TR-116 and taken into
    custody. NOTE: The chances of this weapon being carried as standard
    issue on any vessel are NONEXISTANT. It was never mass produced. It
    may make an interesting character twist for an officer to have one
    as a keepsake of sorts, but your COS is highly unlikely to let you
    use it on a mission, so restrict it to the same place as Worf's
    Bat'leth, on the wall of your quarters.

Type IIId Pulse Compression Phaser Rifle - EVA Variant
:   This weapon is identical in terms of specification to the Type IIIc
    with the exception of a specially adapted grip and trigger system
    designed to accommodate the bulk of EVA suits.

Heavy
-----

Mark I Photon Mortar
:   Primarily a large scale infantry weapon \*not\* carried on non
    combat oriented vessels, this launcher is designed to fire high
    powered photon grenades up to 40,000 metres.

:   *Mass*: 3.2 kg (fully loaded)

:   *Length*: 40 cm

:   *Capacity*: Standard Clip holds 10 grenades.

:   *Note*: This weapon is limited in availability and use to wartime
    conditions or extreme combat zones and will be stocked only as
    mission conditions require.

Isomagnetic Disintegrator
:   This shoulder mounted weapon is issued to the Armouries of combat
    and deep exploratory vessels only. Utilising mammoth capacity power
    cells and larger pulse compression technology this weapon is capable
    of projecting a toroidal plasma charge powerful enough to destroy
    several cubic metres of rock instantly. The advantage inherent in
    this weapon is its ability to adjust the power setting, something
    missing in the larger Tetryon Pulse Launcher.

:   *NOTE*: This Weapon is ONLY available on Combat oriented vessels and
    deep exploration ships.

Tetryon Pulse Launcher
:   A newly designed weapon for the use by Starfleet ground forces and
    security personnel, the Tetryon Pulse Launcher is perhaps the most
    powerful handheld weapon in Starfleet's arsenal. The device was
    designed as a single-person plasma cannon for use against small
    craft and heavily fortified emplacements. Building on the success of
    the Starfleet Avalon R&D facility to grow nearly flawless emitter
    crystals in a ground-based micro-gravity environment, the pulse
    launcher is effectively a miniaturized version of the pulse phaser
    used on newer Starships. Whilst much of this theoretical research
    has been applied to the Type-IIIb Pulse Compression rifle making it
    the first true transitional-phase accelerator, the Tetryon pulse
    launcher takes this a step further. As such, this weapon lacks the
    variety of power settings typical of a type-II or type-III phaser.
    When the trigger is depressed, the weapon fires a collimated beam of
    Tetryon particles which rebound from the target to the unit,
    providing range and vector information to the acquisition
    sub-systems. A rapid-discharge Sarium Krellide power cell, coupled
    with high-speed plasma accelerator coils and a ten-stage cascading
    pre-fire chamber allow for longer periods of sustained pulse fire
    than previous models of phasers, making it a truly automatic weapon.
    The discharge emerges as a focused pulse of superheated, rarefied
    plasma. The pulse launcher emits energy comparable to a Type IV
    phaser emitter and incorporates the biometric control systems now
    common to modern weapons systems. The weapon is capable of firing
    continuous or wide beam settings.

:   *NOTE*: This weapon is ONLY available on combat oriented vessel and
    deep explorations ships.

Grenades
--------

Photon Grenades
:   Photon grenades are one of the most devastating personnel weapons
    developed by the Federation. Their use is strictly controlled,
    usually limited strictly to wartime conditions. They are effectively
    a more adjustable version of the microtorpedo used in modern fighter
    craft. Photon grenades may be set to explode upon impact, at some
    altitude above the ground, or at some preset time, up to ten hours
    after impact. Both the power level and blast radius of these weapons
    may also be carefully controlled. They have five distinct blast
    settings and a variable blast radius ranging from 3 to 10 meters.

:   *Mass*: 0.2 kg

:   *Note*: This weapon is limited in availability and use to wartime
    conditions or extreme combat zones and will be stocked only as
    mission conditions require.

:   *Settings*:

    1.  *Flash*: All humanoids inside the blast radius without special
        eye protection are blinded for approximately five minutes.

    2.  *Heavy Stun*: Stun all humans in blast radius for one hour.

    3.  *Heavy Thermal*: Melts most metals in blast radius

    4.  *Light Disrupt*: Vaporize all Humanoids and softer materials
        within the blast radius

    5.  *Heavy Disrupt/Explode*: Any none shielded object is obliterated
        on contact. Shielded objects are severely damaged dependant upon
        size and power of shielding.

Armour
------

It is worth mentioning here that combat armour is use *only* by the
Starfleet Marine corp. and large combat oriented Vessels such as the
Maverick and Pendragon class. It is \*not\* standard issue and is used
only in large scale Infantry combat missions or special operations
missions.

The combat helmet is part of all marine battle dress. The helmet has an
integral short-range communicator. It is also equipped with various
sensors that allow night-vision, infrared scanning, magnification up to
5x, and a targeting interface with most Standard weapons from the Type
III Pulse Compression Rifle Upwards.

Standard field combat dress consists of lightweight, reinforced ablative
armour plating over a flexible mesh base. The plates affixed to the mesh
cover arms, torso, and legs, with ridged joints to allow full freedom of
movement. The armour is intended to provide protection against physical
attacks, nullify most projectile weapons, and give some level of
protection against low-level energy weapons or indirect hits from more
powerful beam weapons. Direct hits from a phaser set to level five and
higher will likely kill the wearer of standard combat dress and heavy
stun will be effective when a direct hit is taken to torso or head.
Note: larger field combat dress may be worn over a conventional vacuum
suit and worn with a sealable helmet and gloves. This adds
zero-atmosphere capabilities to the suit.

How Combat Works In STF
=======================

Brief Introduction To Turn Based Combat
---------------------------------------

In ages past the most popular form of role play combat was Turn Based, a
system which allowed descriptive epic battles. The final ‘rules' for TB
were settled in MSN role play years before it was closed down and
they're good enough to be used in any situation and any role play
system, including our own in STF.

The system described below comes from a very old document first written
by a veteran role player named Jeff Allen and has been adapted for the
purposes of this course.

Turn Based Role Playing Starfleet Style
---------------------------------------

TB means Turn Based, this means that each party gets two types of posts
within their turn, a Defence post, and an Attack post. This makes for
two in one single round as if it's being done in real life
simultaneously. The defence post requires a defensive posted against the
other party's attack, the attack post is the return attack.

Remember, just because a hit seems impossible to block, does not mean it
is. GM's in STF are not out to kill you and short of you posting
something truly ridiculous they will always give you a way out. The
point of TB fighting is to post an attack that seems impossible to block
but is not. It is your GM's job to figure out how to get out if it, if
they can. GM's, as a rule are not permitted to put a player in an
impossible position and will only cause direct damage to a character at
the request of the player in question or as the result of a death notice
being issued for actions committed that would invariably result in
injury.

There are four golden rules that should be followed at all times when
conducting combat In Character

1.  *Never mod* : moding is the term applied to anything that could be
    considered physically impossible. If you're a short athletic female
    Human security officer you're never going to be able to pick up an
    eight foot tall Klingon and hurl him across the room anymore than a
    six foot three 280lb male human security officer built like
    Sylvester Stallone is going to be able to outrun that same athletic
    female Security Officer. Moding also covers acts which could be
    considered impossible, e.g. you're trapped in a burning ship with no
    way to beam out and you step through an airlock into space to get
    back to your shuttle. These situations and others like them are the
    kind that will earn you death notices, which a GM issues when
    something impossible is attempted that would endanger the life of
    the Character in question. Three death notices result in the GM
    being granted the power to kill that Character and it is then the
    CO's prerogative to allow the player to return to the ship with
    another character or to remove them permanently from the roster.

2.  *Never Use A God Character* : We all know it's fun to be superhuman,
    ultra powered and completely untouchable, but let's face it, if you
    create a character like that no one is going to want to play with
    you, least of all the GM. I've seen it a number of times in STF and
    it's caused most of us grief at some point or other. If you aren't
    aware of the canon rules concerning Starfleet Officers then you
    should always feel free to ask any of the hundred or so experts in
    the club. Playing a genetically engineered super soldier Security
    Officer will not earn you any respect and will likely get you a
    flood of emails informing you that your character is impractical
    because Canon established in Deep Space Nine specifically states
    that genetically engineered beings were not permitted to enter
    Starfleet in any capacity, the sole exception being Doctor Julian
    Bashir, and only then because his father took the fall for
    committing the crime, and yes, it is a crime within the Federation.
    That is just one example, but I have seen some more extreme cases,
    even going so far as to create X-Men characters, arguing that there
    was a crossover book that gave them the right to play a Wolverine
    character. If you want to play that sort of character and your CO
    permits is then there's nothing that any of us can do to stop you
    short of complaining to the FComm, but bear in mind that no one will
    want to play with you if you do.

3.  *Never Play Immortal Characters* : It's fun and it gives you the
    satisfaction of knowing that you can walk the streets of an alien
    world and blast the species to hell, but again, no one will want to
    play with you. Remember that you *must* keep your characters
    reasonable and within canon rules otherwise you just sap the fun for
    others involved. Fortunately I've never actually seen an Immortal
    character in STF, and I fervently hope that I never do.

4.  *Never Auto-Action* : This is the act of posting something and
    assigning a response to another character. This is one of \*the\*
    biggest no-no's in STF. You never \*ever\* play the actions of
    another Character unless they are under your direct control (i.e.
    NE's). If you do this in combat you will likely earn the wrath of
    your GM and several rather lengthy email complaints from the players
    involved. If you post an attack that involves you, for example
    firing your phaser, you do not post whether the phaser hits it's
    intended target, you merely \*attempt\* to hit it. It's up to the
    owner of the Character you are firing at that will determine whether
    or not the phaser hits. If it is considered unlikely that you would
    miss then nine times out of ten the beam will strike, though
    occasionally, if you are fighting a PC Character they will argue
    this and it becomes the purview of the GM to judge the posts based
    on detail, quality and realism. Try to think of it like this, how
    would you feel If you were in a fight and your opponent posted that
    he blew a hole in your chest, killing you instantly?

One Final Word To The Wise
--------------------------

Always remember, you're permitted one attack and one defence section to
each combat post, and this is for a reason. Consider that each post
consists of about five to ten seconds of game time, during that time
your Character will be able to do two things, defend and counterattack.
I've seen people play out eight and more things in a single post, which
gives the opponent no space in which to respond and will eventually take
the fun out of combat, leaving you with that same, age old dilemma that
no one wants to play with you.

Defend and Attack, that's all, remember those two words if you take
nothing else from this course.

Other Branches Of The Service
=============================

Within STF there are a number of other Branches, some that are
extrapolations from Canon and non Canon sources and some that are
explained in a fair amount of Canon detail.

Marines
-------

Marines are an interesting group that are only used on one ship, the
U.S.S Endeavour in Fleet 5. There were no direct references to Marine
units in any of the Star Trek series other than Enterprise in which they
were used quite effectively as a Standard shipboard force. They have
received passing nods in a number of episodes of the Next Generation and
Deep Space Nine and would undoubtedly have been used as ground combat
troops during the Dominion War. The specific rules governing Marines on
the Endeavour can be obtained from the CO. They are a little too long
winded to post directly in this course, but generally speaking Marine
spots are only given to more experienced players because of the
difficulty found in accurately portraying such a difficult field.

Intelligence
------------

Intelligence is my personal favourite and my active COS characters both
have Intelligence backgrounds, though it's also a sort of grey area, if
you'll forgive the pun. The only active Intelligence position in STF is
the swing position of Chief Intelligence Officer, which, like all swing
positions is dependant upon the CO in question and is notoriously
difficult to play. There have been a number of episode in Deep Space
Nine and several that I can think of in The Next Generation dealing with
Intelligence. Every Trek fan is familiar with the Section 31 storyline
that ran through Deep Space Nine, though it is worth noting that not all
Intelligence branches are quite so evil. CIO's generally have very
little to do unless the sim in question has an Intelligence undertone,
though it can be very rewarding and a lot of fun. If you choose an
Intelligence related character it's a good idea to do a lot of research
into the field in the 21st and 24th Centuries to help flesh them out.
Remember though that having your character hail from Section 31 is
highly unlikely as that is an organisation from which you do not leave
lightly. If there are any specific questions about Intelligence theory,
practice or Character development don't hesitate to contact me at
andrewrobinson257@msn.com.

Tactical Officers
-----------------

The position of Chief Tactical Officer is a swing position in STF, much
like the CIO and Marine spots. The presence of a CTO on a vessel
somewhat alters the position and responsibilities of the Chief of
Security in the sense that the CTO becomes the officer primarily
assigned to the Tactical station on a Starship Bridge. Tactical Officers
are tasked with the ships combat operations and is generally only
present on combat oriented vessels because of the nature of the
position. In this situation Security Officers responsibilities no longer
extend to ship to ship combat, as that's handled by the CTO. Obviously
because of the limited scope of the characters duties it can be
difficult to play a Tactical Officer and within STF the line between CTO
and COS is often blurred by circumstance.

A Final Caution
===============

Always remember that as a Security Officer you are not there to play
god, you don't get to decide what you do or do not shoot, that's up to
the Captain and your Chief of Security. You will spend 90% of your time
not even carrying a phaser unless you serve aboard an Outpost or
Starbase, and for that other 10% In Character you should concentrate on
\*not\* using it.

Don't Go Overboard
------------------

Never go overboard with your Character. Don't give him every ability
imaginable and don't make him preternaturally alert and accurate. All
people have flaws, including Starfleet Officers, and in my experience
it's usually those flaws that set us apart from everybody else. We're
here to have fun, so give your Characters depth and colour, not shallow
perfection and invulnerability.

Also, always work within the Starfleet framework. You don't get to
torture a prisoner, that's a quick way to a court martial for your
Character and an abbreviated tour of duty. You don't get to blow things
to hell with Tetryon pulse launchers unless another war breaks out or
you get sent on a mission that's guaranteed to need heavy firepower.
Whilst it's pretty to look at weapons like that and it makes you look
big and heavy to walk around armed like a tank you won't be carrying
that Photon Mortar on your Promenade patrol.

Never Go Beyond Canon
---------------------

There are literally hundreds of books out there, quite possibly even
thousands that claim to be Star Trek, but are usually heavily outdated
or inaccurate and use weapons and technology that have never even been
hinted at in Canon, so just because you've read it in a book does not
mean that you get to play Wolverine as a Security Officer. I'll be the
first to admit that there are a stable of authors out there who write
some absolutely brilliant works that do nothing short of enrich our
knowledge of Trek technology and methodology, but bear in mind that most
of what you read is Fan Fiction and doesn't go down well with the other
members of the club when you try and use it.

Stick to Canon and the STF Reference Manual wherever possible. This
isn't to say that you can't create your own technology. We're all for
new designs and new specs for weapons, species and technologies, but
ensure that you get them approved for use before you start, particularly
with Weapons and Technology (which should be critiqued and approved by
the Engineering Department/Research and Development Department).

Be Aware Of Your Ship Class
---------------------------

Above all else, before you lock and load, be aware of what ship you are
stepping aboard. If you're looking to blow those alien scum to hell then
you should be leaning more towards the larger classes such as Maverick
and Pendragon that are more combat oriented. If you're looking for a
rewarding time that will give you massive character development
opportunities then head towards the Viking and Genesis class vessels.
Personally, given the choice, I'd rather play a Science vessel any day
because it gives you the opportunity to create characters of such rich
history and realism that if you do finally take that step to the darker
side of combat classes' people will find it a true pleasure to interact
with you.

Final Question (Worth a Total of 30 Marks)
------------------------------------------

Below is a scenario in which you may find yourself. Write a brief
outline of how you intend to resolve the situation and then create an In
Character post following that plan. Marks will be awarded for realism,
technical accuracy, spelling and grammar. For the purposes of this
scenario you will act as your own GM and are free to play out anything
that would require GM interaction. Bear in mind that there are a number
of possible solutions to this scenario and you will not be judged for
getting it ‘wrong', only for how well you handle the situation and how
well you depict its resolution. Remember when you write out this answer
what I have stressed time and time again about the role of a Security
Officer.

You are Chief of Security aboard a Pendragon Class Cruiser and you are
sent in to negotiate a truce between two warring civilisations, the
P'mARt's and the Pring'mela. You beam down with a negotiations team to a
secure site to conduct peace talks with the representatives of each
race, but halfway through the talks a firefight erupts and half the
representatives are killed. A rogue element of the P'mARt's military
takes the Federation negotiators hostage, holding them in the
negotiations room. The room has only one entrance and no ventilation
system, it is in effect a large square stone box protected by a
dampening field that prevents transporters from effecting them. The
rogue soldiers threaten to kill the hostages unless negotiations cease.
Outside of the room now both the P'mARt's and Pring'mela representatives
urge you to assist them in resolving this situation and getting the
negotiations back on track as they don't wish to see the cause of peace
destroyed after so long at war.
