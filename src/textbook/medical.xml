    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>Welcome to the STF Academy medical course. The goal of the course is to give you a better understanding on how to role-play an STF medical character, and to give you hints and tips that will hopefully make you excel in that role. At the end of the course, there will be a short exam to test your newfound abilities.</para>
    <para>The first thing to mention about the role of the medical character is that they are not engineers, science officers, nor security personnel, (although they may well be proficient with a matter inducer, Seismograph, or a phaser and had security training, there are other officers on the ship for that role). As a doctor, it should also be pointed out, that a doctor's number one directive is to the well being of his patient's and those that are sick and injured. This doesn't mean you should mutiny the ship to get your way, but plead to the captain's better side.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="med-101">
    <title>Your Character</title>
    <para>OYou have a choice of 3 characters to role-play. These are medic, nurse, and doctor.</para>
    <para>The role most people choose is that of the doctor. The other roles are a little restricted in what they can do. For example, a medic would not perform surgery on patients, as they would lack the necessary training.</para>
    <para>Below is a brief summary of how I would categorize the three roles that you can choose from.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Medic</title>
      <para>The way I look at the role of a medic, I would class it as that of an orderly or lab assistant, albeit one that has been trained in more that just first aid. Their main job is to assist the doctors and nurses in their duties on the ship. The training that they would have received would be considerably higher than that of a first-aider by today's standards. After all, the technology is considerably higher, and as the computer diagnosis' most illnesses and injuries, I would think that they would be allowed to treat minor problems. Of course in emergency situations they are allowed to treat patients to stabilize them in order to get them to a doctor.</para>
      <para>Other major roles of the medic are labwork, and the care of the equipment. The medic would be able to perform simple lab duties such as blood and DNA analysis, and other similar tests. The responsibility of caring for the equipment would also fall on them. They would be responsible for the storage, the cleaning and the diagnostics of it.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Nurse</title>
      <para>The role of the nurse is not too far different from that of the medic. The differences are the medical tasks they do. Their main task, apart from aiding the doctors in treating patients, is the welfare of the patients in sickbay. They carry out the routine treatments on the patients, whether they are in or out patients. Their training would be more advanced than that of a medic, but in their quiet periods, they would assist the medics in caring for the equipment.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Doctor</title>
      <para>As mentioned before, this is the role most people take on. It is less restrictive on duty, as the doctor can carry out all the tasks of nurses and medics and much much more. This is the character I would recommend you choose.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>My 2 Cents</title>
      <para>Unless you are a strong role-player, I would recommend you choosing the Doctor. The other two roles will require much on your behalf, as it would be up to you to find things to do not the GM.</para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section id="med-102">
    <title>Species</title>
    <para>No, this isn't your character species; it's everybody else's character types. The majority of STF characters are probably human but there are many other types too, such as Klingon, Trill, and El Aurian, to name but a few.</para>
    <para>I would have liked to write quite a bit about the medical side of the species in the Star Trek arena, but unfortunately, the information is pretty much non existant. In STF, you can look at the IC Library under the GMDept for race information. Also places like startrek.com carry plenty of information about the different races, (again not in a medical sense), although it does contain many diseases and equipment in its library databanks.</para>
  </section>
  <section id="med-103">
    <title>Equipment</title>
    <para>One of the most important things about being a Doctor, Nurse, or medic in the 24th century is knowing the equipment you have at your disposal. Below is a list of some of the medical equipment available of that time frame.</para>

    <title>Non Player Characters</title>
    <para>Non-Players Characters, or NPCs as they are referred to in STF (also referred to as NEs [Nameless Ensigns]) are probably as important to a medical character as the equipment and medicine they use. How do they work? You ask.</para>
    <para>If you look at Star Trek, there are more people on the ship/station than the six or so main characters. What you're doing by creating a NPC is making a character that only has a bit part in the sim, like the extras on the set.</para>
    <para>You don't create the character as a 2nd character on a ship; you create it to interact with your character or somebody else character who needs the medical department. For example, if the ship you are on is a bit lacking in the med dept (a CMO and a Med-1 only), and both of these are on an away mission, that leaves the sickbay unattended should people need it. What you or the CMO should do is have a NPC tending sickbay till one of you returns.</para>
    <para>As another example you have been given a task to do, but you, as most Doctors in hospitals would, have a nurse or medic assist you. Yes, you could have the med-2 assist, but that would slow the R-P down waiting for the posts. An alternative is to create a NPC Nurse or Medic to assist, and you R-P the character.</para>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <para>You have now completed the Star-Fleet Academy Medical Course, well almost. The last hurdle is the exam.</para>
    <para>By studying this course, you have hopefully learnt what it takes to play a good medical character in STF. This doesn't mean you have to stick to this course. Its only purpose is to give you guidance where you may need it.</para>
    <para>You should feel free to create your own diseases and cures and also the equipment you need to help your through your time in STF. Though with the equipment, it really should be approved by Star-Fleet Engineering to be official, but who says you can't jury-rig something for a sim.</para>
    <para>That said, its exam time. Just email me your answers and I'll grade them as soon as can and get the results back to you and the Academy personnel. My email address is <ulink url="mailto:medical-tutor@star-fleet.com">medical-tutor@star-fleet.com</ulink>.</para>
    <para>Note from author I would like to take this opportunity to thank Captain Paul Jones and my wife, Commodore Deanne Ashton for their contributions. Without them it might have taken a lot longer to write this course. Thanks Fleet Capt. Steve Ashton.</para>
