Introduction
============

Welcome to the Admin course, designed for COs, XOs, and GMs to get them
acquainted with the functions of the administrative menu. There is no
exam to take, or grade to worry about. This course simply goes through
the functions of all the administrative areas of the ship.

Now, if you look on the ship's MOTD (Message Of The Day), along the top
right-hand side, you will see 3 brand new tabs ("Admin", "Edit", and
"E-mail"), we will examine the functions of each of these new tabs in
detail throughout this course.

Lesson One: The Tabs
====================

Before we go into a lot of detail, it's time to discuss the basic
functions of these three new tabs.

Admin
:   The place COs/XOs and GMs go to add new characters, view all
    characters on the ship, create log entries and add and remove
    subscribers as well as a few other functions that will be discussed
    in greater detail over the next few pages of the course.

Edit
:   This is where you can edit the MOTD, both the basic look of it and
    simply updating your own special section of it. You need to be
    familiar with HTML coding as well as other codes that may be
    employed in the maintenance of the MOTD. If only to avoid undoing
    someone's hard work by accidentally deleting code.

E-mail
:   Sends a mass e-mail to all subscribers on your board. Not
    recommended for use, it may be a good idea to simply ignore this and
    carry on. Generally, if you need to reach all the members of your
    crew, it would probably be easiest to simply post a note on the ship
    regarding it rather than to spam everyone who has happened to
    subscribe to your board. We'll go into what subscribers are and how
    that works later in the course.

Lesson Two: Characters - Editing & Creating
===========================================

The first two options under the Admin tab will be discussed together as
they are related.

Character List
--------------

This link brings you to the list that is your full roster, including
AWOLed and unrostered characters, unrostered NPCs, unrostered GM
Controlled Characters, etc.

This section allows you to see the "sort order" of every character on
the ship. Sort order sets the order in which the character displays on
the roster, without sort order, every character is organized
alphabetically by character name. COs can organize characters however
they wish(as an XO or GM, you may want to adhere to the sort orders to
keep your CO happy).

To start the editing process either to assign a sort order or some other
option, you click on the character name on the roster or in the
character list. This brings up the character information screen and
you'll note in the top right-hand corner of the window is an "edit" tab,
clicking on that brings up the character editing screen.

The options available under this screen are numerous, let's discuss them
one by one:

Rank
:   Obviously as CO, you'll occasionally see the need to promote people.
    This permits you to select their rank from a drop down menu. It is
    very important to note that as CO, you can only promote a character
    above the rank of Lt. Commander if that player already has a rank
    higher than Lt. Commander or with permission from your FComm. When
    in doubt, ask your FComm, they should be able to clear up any
    confusion you might have on this topic.

Position & Custom Position
:   Again, typically COs only use this function, but occasionally an XO
    may be given permission by the CO to use this. Position is another
    drop-down menu, with all the standard positions organized by
    department. Note, the CNS is located under the medical department
    and the CTO is located under the security department.

    If you have a unique swing position on your ship(i.e: a lot of
    alt-RPGs are in this situation, but some standard ships can have
    these too), you'll be using the "custom position" option, which is a
    dialog box permitting you to type in whatever you please.

Character Name
:   This can be changed by you or by the owner of that character.
    Generally when adding a new character to the ship, you'll use this
    box to note the character name.

Rostered
:   This option is a drop down menu that permits you to choose whether
    or not that character displays on the public roster that is viewable
    by everyone(That character will still display on your administrative
    roster). You may also be using this tab to unroster an AWOL player
    for a period before deleting them completely from the roster.

Species
:   Allows you to assign a species or race to each character(Human,
    Vulcan, etc.). Regular players do not have the option of editing
    this, but COs should ensure that any changes to this are at the wish
    of the player of the character.

Sort-Order
:   This option permits you to select the order in which that character
    displays on the roster. You can assign more than one person to the
    same sort order. For example, if you have five Lieutenants on the
    ship, you can assign them all "4" and they'll appear after those at
    level 1, 2, and 3, but will display alphabetically within their
    "order". You have the numeric range of -10(first to display on
    roster) to 10(last to display on roster), so you have quite a range
    of numbers by which to sort characters on your roster.

Biography
:   Allows you or the owner of the character to enter a biography,
    limited HTML tags are allowed(The ones permitted are listed beneath
    the dialogue box as well as a bit more information about links).
    Very rarely will you use this function, as it's available to the
    owners of the characters to edit for themselves. I think for the
    most part this is a "hands-off" type of section of the character
    edit screen.

Audience
:   Permits you to select the area or ship to which a particular
    character is assigned. The default of the present ship you're
    working from is automatically checked off(i.e: if you're editing
    from the USS Genesis that's the box that will be checked). Typically
    you'll only look at this quickly to ensure there isn't a bug in the
    system and to make sure you're keeping that character on the right
    ship. As an aside note, the only areas you will see under the
    audience option are the areas to which you are a subscriber.

Height, Age & Weight
:   Permits you to assign a height, age and weight to a particular
    character. Again unless it is your own character that you are
    editing, you will only be uploading info given to you by the author
    of that character. Only administrators can access these three boxes.

Authoring Information
:   Assigns which user this character belongs to. You'll need to know a
    person's username in order to use this.

Create New Character
--------------------

Clicking this will bring you back to the already familiar character edit
screen, only it'll be completely blank. Assign all the information you
have on the new character by filling in the boxes(typically Rank,
Position, Character Name, Rostered, Sort Order). You will notice one big
difference between the edit and create character screen, you do not have
the option of selecting an audience when creating a new character.

At the bottom, you'll need to ensure you choose the proper "owner" of
the character. In order to do this, you'll need to know the username of
the person you wish to add, full names will not work(Unless of course
that person's username and full name are the same, in which case it
would work).

When editing and creating characters, you have the option to preview
your changes/creation by clicking "preview" instead of "submit". On the
preview screen, your changes appear right at the top, with the regard
submit character boxes down below. In order for changes to be made
permanent on your ship, you need to click "submit".

Lesson Three: Subscribers
=========================

This lesson involves the last two options under the Admin tab,
Subscribers and Add Subscribers.

In order to post on a ship, you need to be a subscriber of that ship(You
can read all the notes you want as a non-subscriber).

Subscribers
-----------

This page will permit you to see who can make a post on your ship and
allow you to assign administrators to that ship. Typically this is the
FComm, AFComm, CO, XO and GM of the ship. To create an administrator,
you simply click on the "Admin: Create" link and follow the prompts.

The same is true for the "remove" option, this permits you to remove
subscribers. For instance, if you have a member who is no longer a
member of your ship, you have the option of removing them.

It is recommended that you do keep your subscriber lists as clean as
possible. Ideally subscribers are all the members of the ship, plus the
Fleet Command staff(FComm and AFComm). I can't think of any reason a
non-member of your crew might need to make a post unless they are part
of the Fleet Command staff.

Add Subscribers
---------------

To add a subscriber to your ship, you merely need to click this option
from the admin tab, you're taken to a dialog box.

You can add multiple users by separating each with a comma and as with
the character creation, you need to know the user name of the person you
wish to add.

Once all the names are typed in, you click submit and you're done.

Lesson Four: Log Entries, Notes & Pages
=======================================

The last three options on the admin tab will be discussed together.

Create New Log Entry
:   Clicking this brings you to a dialogue screen where you type in what
    you want to say in your log and hit submit, that's then uploaded to
    the log entries where you and everyone else can read it. COs are the
    only ones permitted to use this function unless they have given
    permission for someone else to use it as well.

Create New Note
:   Performs the same function as "Post Note" option does at the bottom
    of the MOTD.

Create New Page
:   A redundant section that mostly repeats what we've discussed
    earlier. Creating new characters, new notes, etc.

Lesson Five: The Edit Tab
=========================

The edit tab, as discussed in lesson one, requires knowledge of HTML
coding.

Three dialogue boxes are listed in this tab:

Slogan
:   A brief description for the group details block and group directory.
    i.e: "The USS Columbia is a Discovery Class Vessel that has been
    training cadets since 2003."

MOTD
:   This is where you put all of your essentials, coding the CO, XO, GM
    sections, the Departmental orders, etc. Uses mainly HTML coding.

CSS
:   This is for advanced users only, you need to know CSS in order to
    use this section.

If you have any questions on how to modify your MOTD, the IDept
(Internet Department) is who to contact for answers and support.

With the edit tab, you can preview any minor changes to the MOTD by
clicking "preview" before you click "submit"(Which makes your changes
permanent). However if you are completely changing the look of the MOTD,
preview will not always work.

Conclusion
==========

We have been through all the different options of the three tabs that
appear once you've been made an administrator of a ship or board.

It's always a good idea to read over all your changes before clicking
submit. This will help eliminate most of those dastardly typos, which
could wreak havoc on your poor MOTD!

Most importantly, don't be discouraged if you make mistakes. We may play
aliens in this club, but all of us are human and mistakes are part of
that. There is nothing wrong with spotting a mistake after the fact. The
Admin tabs are forgiving, you can just pop right back into the tab you
need and correct that mistake easily enough. Don't be afraid to ask for
help either.

Last and most importantly, congratulations and good luck with your new
post. No doubt you've worked very hard for it and you deserve it! If you
have any questions about this course, please contact the Academy
Commandant(acad@star-fleet.com).

Thanks for reading my course!

And thank you to the following people who have graciously assisted me in
producing that I hope was a very productive and relevant course for you:

-   Robin Bird

-   Jen Herr

-   Terry Calvin

-   Chris DuBois

And a thank you to the previous author and contributors to the course
for writing a comprehensive look at our old system's administrative
menu, this course is vastly different from the old course of course, but
I did use the previous course as a beginning template when I first
started the re-write of this one.
