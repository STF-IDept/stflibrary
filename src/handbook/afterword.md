Afterword
=========

STF is one of the oldest and most unique Star Trek roleplay groups, one
of the few to retain its roots in canon trek and its commitment to
maintaining a realistic and most importantly, fun environment.

We welcome you to the club and hope that your time here is rewarding and
productive.
