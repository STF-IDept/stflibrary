	<title>The STF Government</title>
	<para>STF's highest office is that of President. This President and their Vice President are elected once every eight months by the membership after a full election campaign has been conducted on a special ship that only appears at election time called (surprisingly enough) The Election Ship.<para>
	<para>Anyone can run for President provided they receive two nominations for the position. Following a period of voting, the winner is announced and that President/Vice President team becomes the head of our government.</para>
	<para>Prior to October 2009, Presidential authority was theoretically absolute, and short of the cabinet staging a coup d'etat, they were largely unhindered in performing any action they wished. In October 2009, President Andrew Robinson created a Bills and Bylaws method of establishing club law, the elected three member council known as Executive Government Oversight. The EGO council has the mandate to rein in the power of the President should he or she act in a manner not congruant with the best interests of the membership. The Egotists, as they are known, have the power to overturn member bans, veto bills and, most importantly, impeach a renegade President who is found to not be acting in the best interests of the membership.<para>
	<para>When they assume office, the Presidents first duty is to appoint a cabinet. The cabinet consists of the Directors for each of our departments (Gamemaster, Personnel, Internet and Engineering), the Academy Commandant and the six Fleet Commanders, along with the President and Vice President. These then name their assistants to varying positions within their departments. The cabinet, and their assistants are referred to as the 'Government'.</para>
