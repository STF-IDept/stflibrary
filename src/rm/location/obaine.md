Overview
========

The Obaine Nebula is located deep within Fleet 2's borders. The nebula
itself is full of plasma, though plans of the plasma being mined was
dropped when the team of scientists discovered its volitile nature. The
nebula consists of tons of plasma, which attracts to warp cores and
other electrical devices. The nebula also eminates a large quantity of
delta radiation, though annoculations are required when entering the
nebula, the nebula has been nicknamed "the hell pit".

Within the Nebula contains a small group of asteroids, which have always
been there. These rocks shield the radiation effect as well as the
strong plasma forces. Although testing has been carried out on the
nebula itself to harness the energy from the plasma and hopefully
produce a stable plasma to use in warp cores, no test so far as been
successful.

History
=======

The USS Nautilus, after a specific mission, entered the nebula.
Unfortunately, the crew and ship felt the massive pressure of working
within it, with many crewmembers getting radiation posioning of spots
and warts which leaked out yellow puss. The ship itself was contained in
a shield, which took most of the Nautilus' power. After the ship was
supposidly attacked by an unknown ship, their warp core was stolen and
never seen again.
