Overview
========

Wet, very wet, would sum up Ferenginar's climate. So much so that
Ferengis find "the smell of rotting vegetation and the rivers of muck"
endearing. So wet that the Ferengi have 178 different words for rain.
Crisp is not a part of the Ferengi vocabulary. Ferenginar is the
homeworld to the Ferengi Alliance. Also to be found are the offices of
the Ferengi Commerce Authority; 40th floor Tower of Commerce and Ferengi
Futures Exchange. Similar to the Stock Exchanges on Earth in 20th/21st
centuries. Ferenginar's centre of commerce is knows as the Sacred
Marketplace. The Grand steps of the Sacred Marketplace are used by the
Grand Nagus to make important proclamations. The administrative centre
is located in the spire topped Tower of Commerce, a part of the Sacred
Marketplace. It is the tallest building in the Ferengi Alliance. All
business activity in the entire Ferengi Alliance, both on and off-world
is regulated at the Tower of Commerce.

History
=======

Unknown to the Federation until 2364 when first contact was made at
Delphi Ardu. The Ferengi history we know of dates back 10,000 years when
they first began to use currency.
