		<title>Overview</title>
		<para>The Galactic Barrier is a massive energy field surrounding the Milky Way Galaxy. It consists of several forms of energy, including mass quantities of psionic energy. This type of energy is not common.</para>
		<para>When a starship enters this field, the excess energy causes power disruption and overloads throughout the ship. Prolonged exposure to the Galactic Barrier may ultimately lead to a ship's destruction.</para>
		<para>To add to this problem, psionic energy disrupts and overloads neurons in a typical human brain in much the same manner as damage to the ship. While within the Galactic Barrier, a ship's crew will get headaches and extreme fatigue if in the barrier for only a matter of moments, and can cause insanity and even death if prolonged exposure to the barrier occurs.</para>
		<para>Usually, the more telepathic a humanoid the more symptoms are intensified. The only exception to this rule are Vulcans, who apparently are not affected by the barrier at all.</para>
		<para>This field can easily be compared the Great Barrier, a similar energy field surrounding the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.</para>

		<title>History</title>
		<para>There are only four instances known to the federation in which a vessel has entered the Galactic Barrier.</para>
		<para>Once by the S.S. Valiant on a mission of exploration. Their original purpose was to come to the edge of the galaxy, then head back. When they arrived at the galaxy's rim, they encountered an energy field known now as the Galactic Barrier. Their flight recorder was later discovered by the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701.</para>
		<para>There were three entries made by the original Enterprise.</para>
		<para>Once after discovering the S.S. Valiant's lost flight recorder in the year 2267. The Enterprise found that the Valiant crew had destroyed themselves in order to prevent takeover of the Federation by some of it's crew. The Enterprise, not knowing what was going on, entered the Barrier in search of answers. A friend of Captain Kirk's who had latent psionic abilities was apparently affected by the barrier's energy, and started to display abnormal telepathic abilities. This individual soon started speaking of ruling all of the Federation(just as the Valiant crew had). Eventually, Kirk had to kill his friend.</para>
		<para>In 2268, another entry and exit was accomplished when alien life-forms named the 'Kelvan', who's home planet was located in a neighboring galaxy, hijacked the Enterprise. The Kelvans' mission was to find a suitable new home for their race, however their vessel was destroyed by the Galactic Barrier. Tricking the Enterprise crew into landing on the planet at which they now had crashed on, using their advanced technology they captured the Enterprise. They transformed the majority of the crew into dodecahedrons, leaving only essential personnel aboard including Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott, Chief Surgeon Leanard McCoy, Chief Science Officer Spock, and Captain James Kirk. They exited the galaxy en route to the Kelvans' homeworld, but soon was thwarted by the remaining Star-Fleet crew. The crew returned to their humanoid shape, and the Enterprise returned within it's own galaxy.</para>
		<para>Finally, once more in 2269 did the original Enterprise enter the Barrier. At the current time, their was a meducian ambassador visiting the ship with two assistants: Dr. Jones, and an individual named Maverick. Maverick was driven insane by jealousy, and took control of the Enterprise' engines, which he had helped design, and piloted the massive starship across the Barrier. Eventually, Chief Science Officer Spock had to perform a mind-meld with the meducian ambassador, considering the ambassador was the only one who knew how to pilot the ship safely out into and out of the Galactic Barrier again. After the mind-meld Kollos, using Spock's body, successfully piloted the Enterprise back into the Milky Way Galaxy.</para>
