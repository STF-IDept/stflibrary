Overview
========

Khitomer is a planet near the Romulan/Klingon border. First heard of in
ST:VI as a neutral planet, later in TNG as a Klingon outpost where Worf
was found as a child.

History
=======

In 2293 the Khitomer Peace Conference was held here. This resulted in
the Khitomer Accords, a peace treaty between the Klingon Empire and the
United Federation of Planets. The Federation and Klingon Empire began to
resume friendly relations. In 2346 the Khitomer Massacre occurred. The
Romulans attacked and killed some 4000 Klingons. One hundred Klingons
were taken prisoner and moved. The attack was made possible by the
betrayal of Ja'rod. This Klingon gave the Romulans secret defence codes.
Two other survivors were discovered and rescued by the crew of the USS
Intrepid, Worf and his nursemaid Kahlest.
