Overview
========

Zones
-----

The Zones, Hot, Ecosphere and Cold, are the areas in which planets are
found.

The Hot zone would be closest to the sun and temperatures on planets
therefore be Hot and unsuitable for life except in microscopic form.
(Read unbearable for humans.)

The Ecosphere would be the area around the sun in which planets could
sustain life, the temperatures there would be moderate on a planet.
(Read suitable for humans.)

The Cold zone would be the area after the ecosphere and furthest away
from the Sun, temperatures there would be incapable of supporting life
except in microscopic forms.

The commentary Halo is where the outer edges of comet orbits or in
interstellar space between stars not bound by any orbit.
