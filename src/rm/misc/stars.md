Stellar Class Subdivisions
==========================

Each star class is divided into 10 subclasses, ranging from 0 (hottest)
to 9 (coolest). Stars are also divided into six categories according to
luminosity:

Ia (most luminous supergiants)
Ib (less luminous supergiants)
II (luminous giants)
III (normal giants)
IV (subgiants)
V (main sequence and dwarfs)
VI (subdwarfs)
VII (white dwarfs)
Example: Earth's star, Sol would be rated as a G2V, which means that it
is a relatively hot (2) G-Class (G) main sequence star (V). So when
naming the sub-class of a star they should be named in the following
format:

[Letter of class][Temperature number 0 to 9][Luminosity category]

> **Note**
>
> Classes R, N, S, T, Q, and W are not in the main sequence above. They
> are used for rare star types. More information on these classes will
> be listed if/when it becomes available in later Paramount-approved
> products or episodes
