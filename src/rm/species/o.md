Overview
========

All that is known about this species was related by Q to Captain
Jean-Luc Picard during a mission to the Galactic Barrier.

This race exist in parts of the multiverse not yet known to even the Q.

The O (name suplied by Q) are beings not unlike the Q, they exist
outside of normal space-time and can alter these two elements.

Unlike the Q, however, they have limited power. This power is limited
only by ill-experience. With practice and coordination, the O can expand
their powers beyond what they were before.

In one instance, a single O was more powerfull then Q. This was achieved
only by insanity, according to Q: "The more insane an omipetent being
is, the more insane his power."

History
=======

This species' existance was first known to Captain Picard by Q showing
Captain Picard Q's many encounters with the O. Q explained that O had
been exiled from the Milky Way galaxy, for the slaughter of an entire
race, by use of the Galactic Barrier. This 'journey', as Q called it,
with Picard took place while the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-E was en
route to the Galactic Barrier to assist Dr. Lem Fal of Betazed in his
attempt to break through the barrier.

After this attempt, O was allowed to 'squeze' through a crack in the
barrier allowing him access to the galaxy. The Enterprise crew found him
to be insane, and O began terrorizing the ship and using it to fullfill
his purposes.

This O was killed however by the joining of Q and the Calmarian, in an
attempt to rid the galaxy of the evil O.

The only O ever to be in contact with the Q or Federation is now dead,
and it has yet to be seen whether or not more of his kind will appear.
