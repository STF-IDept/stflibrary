Overview
========

The Chiarosans are a warrior race and have a very strict honor system,
very similar to that of the Klingons. They are very hierarchical and
protocol-conscious and can easily be offended. Physically, the race is
very strong due to the harsh environments of their home planet, Chiaros
IV. Their bodies are covered with a coarse fur in the same areas that a
human male has hair. Their bodies are very well defined granting them a
physically strong appearance. They are bipedals and all joints appear to
be triple jointed granting them an extraordinary range of motion, making
them extremely graceful. As with most predators, their teeth are razor
sharp, attributing an unnerving quality to even a friendly smile.

History
=======

z
The Chiarosans have not had warp capability for more than a decade, but
have become the key race in the Geminus Gulf, which lies just outside
the boundaries of both the Federation and Romulan star Empire. Under
recently negotiated agreements, neither the Federation nor the Romulans
could establish a permanent presence in the Gulf until invited to do so
by a space-faring civilization native to the Gulf. As the only
warp-capable culture yet known in the Gulf, the Chiarosans have thus
become the key to the entire region.
