Overview
========

These humanoids are a prime example of what can happen when the Prime
Directive is not honoured. These people became aware of higher level
beings before they were even spaceworthy, and unfortunatly their brain
capacity is very limited, thus they do not have the communication or
intelligence capability to be capable of space flight. However, through
trade and other such means they aquired space vessels from other more
advanced species such as the Romulans and Ferengi. Instead of waiting
for intelligence to grow on it's own naturally, they want instant
knowledge and power, and will resort to violence in order to do so.

History
=======

There are not many incidents with the Federation involving this race,
the Enterprise D encountered them and rendered assistance to the
Pakleds' damaged ship. However, when the Pakled Captain saw how
intelligent Lieutenant Geordi La Forge was, so they held him captive
using Lieutenant La Forge's phaser and kept the Enterprise from
transporting La Forge aboard using a Romulan shielding device.
