About IveSTFiya
===============

IveSTFia was born of a bad pun. In Soviet Russia, there were two main
newspapers. Pravda, or "The Truth", was the official newspaper of the
Communist Party. Isvestiya, or "The News", was the official newspaper of
the government. Both of course were controlled by the same people,
leading to the Russian saying "There is in Truth no news, and in News no
truth."

SNN, and WeBBsights in particular, had a reputation for a time as being
STF's Pravda, since both Mike Ballway and Larry Garfield were members of
the cabinet at the time and more often than not involved in the very
news events they were covering. After the Aye on the WeBB \#7 debacle,
Colin Wyers decided he couldn't let a good joke go and started a new
competitor, IveSTFiya, with the assistance of Owen Townes and former
AOTW writer Bob Spurlin.

IveSTFiya lasted three issues in early 1999. Sadly it was hosted
off-site on xoom.com, and is no longer available.
