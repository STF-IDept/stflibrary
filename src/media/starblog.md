About STarBlog
==============

In mid-2002, STF regular Colin Wyers decided to try and cash in on the
rising popularity of "Blogs" with an STF blog/news/column/thing dubbed
"The USS STarBlog". The blog format made it easy to skip the
difficulties involved in "publication" and "issues", but at the same
time also lent itself far more to editorial content than news. It had
numerous contributors, ranging from Wyers to SNN's Mike Ballway to
assorted random members. Although it never formally ceased operation,
interest quickly wained and it lasted only one brief but active month of
posts.

Although hosted off-site, STarBlog's archives are still available
online.
