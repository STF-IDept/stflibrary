About Tangled WeBB We Weave
===========================

The verbosely-named Tanbled WeBB We Weave was another of the short-lived
publications from the Golden Age of STF Media. Published by Canadian
members Jim Armstrong and Mohammed Younis, TWWW lasted seven issues as
"The Canadian Paper", longer than most of its competitors at the time.
