    <title>History and Mission Overview</title>
    <para>Following the failed Borg invasion of 2367, Starfleet rushed project Defiant to completion.  The end result was considered a total flop when the test ship was found to be incapable of performing.  Discouraged with the results, Starfleet turned its attention elsewhere.  But the Defiant was far from buried.  Like a phoenix rising from the ashes it rose to fame in the Dominion war of 2370, and played a crucial part in halting the second Borg invasion of 2373.  The little war ship had previously been described as "a star ship squeezed into the shell of a fighter."  The ship was overpowered and over-gunned for its size, but had proved itself to be more than equal to many challenges.</para>
    <para>With the end of the Dominion war however, the Defiant Class ships were beginning to return very little.  Designed primarily for combat, they found themselves on border patrols, diplomatic courier missions, convoy escort and other mundane roles in a Federation without a war to fight.  Roles which were quickly being allocated to more capable starships.  Starfleet was considering the retirement of Defiant Class vessels, but wanted to have a similar ship that could fill the particular niche the Defiant Class had created.  Phardos Shipyards responded with the Avenger Class.  Based largely upon its highly successful predecessor, the Avenger was conceived as a high speed, heavily armed and armored escort-destroyer.  By 2375 the specifications were presented to Starfleet Command, and they created quite a stir.  The Avenger offered a significant increase in the Defiant Classes capabilities, but managed to keep the vessel small and compact.</para>
    <para>Capable of the same patrol and escort missions as it's predecessor, the Avenger's also included the latest scientific instruments and a very well furbished laboratory.  The Avenger Class is produced at the Phardos Shipyards at a rate of four vessels per year.  Several ships have been put aside for experimental use and will be used as test-beds for new technologies.  The usefulness of the class is only just becoming apparent and the Phardos engineers are already drafting proposals for a Mark II Avenger with further enhancements, as well as a slightly less capable variant for exporting purposes.</para>
    <para>Despite the efforts of the Phardos designers, the Avenger is slightly less maneuverable than it's predecessor.  This is because the vessel is considerably more massive than the Defiant Class, due to the incredible amount of equipment that has been squeezed into the spaceframe.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Structure and Construction</title>
    <para>The Avenger was designed with integral warp nacelles, reducing the vessels cross-section and making it more difficult to target in battle.  This also has the effect of increasing the efficiency of the energy transfer from the warp core to the nacelles.  Built around a revolutionary heavy duranium/tritanium double hull sporting 1.5 cm of high density rodinium armor plating over the entire ship, the Avenger can soak up a significant amount of fire before taking critical damage.  Like the Defiant class, all internal systems that require access to the vessels exterior are equipped with articulated or jettisonable hull plates.  This means that most of the familiar structures are hidden from view, including docking ports, lifeboats, impulse vents, deuterium/anti-deuterium refill ports and mooring beam and tractor beam emitters.  The hull is strengthened by a high-level structural integrity field (SIF), allowing the vessel to withstand extreme stresses without causing structural damage.</para>
    <para>The inner hull is fitted with a tetra-plast poly alloy and the patented Dynatech Liquiplast" coagulating material.  "Liquiplast" material is always in a gel form until exposed to the vacuum of outer-space, while the tetra-plast poly alloy is a specialized plastic layer that melts when hit by weapons fire.  It than expands to help fill breaches and quickly re-solidifies providing structural support.  While these two systems are designed to provide a patch to small hull breeches like micro-fractures, they can also help maintain the structural integrity of damaged sections when used in conjunction with the ship's SIF.  They also provide an alternative means of maintaining atmospheric pressure if atmospheric force-fields are unavailable, but are ineffective in the case of larger hull breaches.  A series of emergency bulkheads and isolation pocket-doors help seal off damaged sections.</para>
    <para>Atmospheric thrusters and landing struts are located in the hull to facilitate surface landings up to but not exceeding 1.9g environments.</para>
    <para>The Avenger's hull lifetime is expected to be 50 years at least, and the classes refit schedule is as follows: Minor - 2 years, Standard - 10 years, Major - 25 years.</para>
    <para>Avenger Class ships have a standard range of 6 months, but can operate for up to 18 without resupply.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Science and Remote Sensing Systems</title>
    <para>The Avenger's type-7 high gain sensor system can scan 10.6 light-years of space in the low-resolution mode and up to 3.1 light-years in the high-resolution mode.</para>
    <para>The Avenger is normally equipped with a full suite of sensors including:</para>
    <simplelist>
      <member>Wide-angle EM radiation imaging scanner</member>
      <member>Quark population analysis counter</member>
      <member>Gravimetric distortion mapping sensor</member>
      <member>Steerable life form analysis instrument cluster</member>
      <member>Low-frequency EM flux sensor</member>
      <member>Localized subspace field stress sensor</member>
      <member>Parametric subspace field stress sensor</member>
      <member>Variable band optical imaging cluster</member>
      <member>Virtual aperture graviton flux spectrometer</member>
      <member>Very low energy graviton spin polarimeter</member>
      <member>Low-level thermal imaging sensor</member>
      <member>Fixed angle gamma frequency counter</member>
      <member>Virtual particle mapping camera</member>
    </simplelist>
    <para>The sensors are adapted from the standard sensor pallets used on other Federation vessels, and are set behind selectively EM opaque hull plating.  In most battle situations, the sensor clusters can retreat into reinforced wells until action levels have been reduced.  This has the drawback of reducing the effectiveness of the sensors but protects them from sustaining damage in combat operations.  The sensors can be brought into closer contact with the hull plates, returning the sensors to full effectiveness.</para>
    <para>The ship is equipped with 18 probes, two of each configuration from class I to class IX.  In the event additional probes are required however, torpedoes can be removed from the ships arsenal and reconfigured as a slightly less capable class VIII or class IX.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Computer Systems</title>
      <para>The ships main computer core is located on deck 5.  It contains the main isolinear computer grids, power regulators and offices for monitoring staff and mechanics.  It also contains protected file storage areas, where backup copies of vital control software are kept if needed.  Command and control inputs are directed through either the ship's bio-neural circuitry or it's backup ODN and isolinear system.  All computer sub-processors utilize bio-neural technology to increase computer response time.</para>
      <para>The computer core is based on the highly successful M-8A AICS Command System employed on Galaxy Class vessels, the Avenger's isolinear computer core can store 15,696,938 terra bytes of information with an average response time of 0.6959 nanoseconds.  The software package uses the Federation LCARS operating system, including the standard voice interface and an EMH program with the appropriate holo-emitters in sickbay.</para>
      <para>The MARS combat computer is a battlefield artificial intelligence, programmed with every combat tactic used by every known species encountered to date.  The system has an integrated neural network which allows it to analyze and adapt to new situations.  The MARS system works in combat situations to provide the Captain and crew with up-to-the-minute tactical information, including recommended strategies and analysis of potential weaknesses in enemy vessels.  The computer also runs the PAI software that is becoming standard on all Phardos vessels.  The PAI is a rapid-integration unit similar to the MARS combat computer.  The system was programmed to handle autonomous systems more effectively as well as manipulate the vessels warp-field in flight.</para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Warp Propulsion Systems</title>
    <para>The Phardos Engineers were presented with a dilemma when selecting a M/ARA for the Avenger project.  At first the core from Project Defiant was chosen, as it had been so successful in powering that vessel, but the ships were too radically different for it to be a successful mating.  The difficulties encountered almost derailed the Avenger Class from any hope of production, and a new core needed to be chosen.  Unfortunately the small size and unusual configuration of the Avenger's hull meant that a similar warp core would have to be installed.  This was unacceptable as it would reduce the vessels promised capabilities and endanger the contract.  The Phardos engineers found a way to change this by installing a larger and more reliable core horizontally in the ship, rather than the traditional vertical assemblies on other starships.  This M/ARA was actually designed to run in a ship over three and a half times larger than the Avenger.</para>
    <para>Rated at 1500+ Cochranes, the FGC-4500/15 M/ARA is capable of producing an incredible surplus of power.  Tapped with the Avenger's unique EPS handling system the designers knew they had a winner, and decided to increase the ships armament capabilities, deflector shield power and sensor capabilities in order to put as much energy as possible to use.  The warp engines on the prototype were also upgraded to the next class, giving the ship oversized engines to go with it's oversize powerplant.  The increased capabilities would allow the Avenger to maintain a higher cruise velocity as well as reduce the wear on critical components.  To accommodate the larger warp field coils, the beam of the test-ship was actually increased by 8.3 meters.</para>
    <para>The ships cruising speed is warp 5.5, which can be maintained until fuel exhaustion.  Maximum sustainable speed for twelve hours is warp 7.2 and the maximum warp speed is 9.8.  Due to the positioning of the engine nacelles, the engines are of a fixed-wing configuration.  The z-axis of the warp field is manipulated by varying the subspace field produced by the warp coils, and as such the engines are non-damaging to subspace.  Because manipulating the warp-field during use is an exacting process, the PAI is programmed to automatically adjust the field to get the most efficiency.</para>
    <para>In catastrophic emergencies, the Avenger M/ARA is ejected aft beneath the impulse engines.  The prototype vessel had the ability to eject it's engine nacelles, but later Avenger's with their integral engines are unable to accomplish this.  Instead the vital engine hardware, such as the warp field coils, are dumped as one assembly out the aft of the hull.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Impulse Propulsion Systems</title>
    <para>The main impulse engines are located in a tail on the aft section of the hull.  They are equipped with thrust vectoring systems to help increase the vessels maneuverability, which is equivalent to the Defiant Class.  The maximum impulse velocity of the ship with all engines running is limited to 0.30c.  This is to prevent the ship from experiencing any time dilation effects which ships begin to experience in excess of this speed.  The limiter program can be disabled to allow access to the full available power of the engines, which when overloaded with auxiliary reactors or injected with anti-matter can provide 130-140% power for a limited amount of time.</para>
    <para>To augment the impulse propulsion system, an above average compliment of RCS thruster assemblies has been installed.  These thrusters are normally used for precision flight maneuvers, such as docking, but can also be used to increase manoeuverability during combat situations or as an alternative means of maintaining attitude control.</para>
    <para>Catastrophic emergency procedures include the jettisoning of IPS fusion reactors and other engine hardware.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Tactical Systems</title>
    <para>The Avenger's armament is very heavy for it's size.  Two fixed torpedo launchers, two "strip" phaser arrays, and four pulse phaser banks give the Avenger a significant punch, while the new FSQ-120 shielding offers more then adequate protection.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Defensive Shields</title>
      <para>The FSQ-120/B Deflector System is an improved version of Phardos/Orion's FSQ-120 and 120/A series.  Designed especially for combat vessels, the shield emitters themselves are designed to run at a higher peak efficiency, thanks to up-rated cooling systems and energy relays.  This allows the shields to be run for longer periods at maximum performance.  A powerful subspace-field discriminator/amplifier coil was included in the defensive suite to allow the shields to switch to a variety of modulations automatically.</para>
      <para>The Avenger is protected by six interconnecting shield generators, providing a maximum graviton load of 1344 megawatts, with a maximum energy dissipation rate of 3.7x10^5 kilowatts.  Two auxiliary generators can provide emergency shielding for a few seconds, but are only rated at 167 megawatts with a maximum energy dissipation rate of 4.5x10^4 kilowatts.  This is not enough to protect the ship in a long firefight, but can be used to buy a few seconds for a quick escape.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Phaser Systems</title>
      <para>Two type VII "strip" phaser arrays are integrated into the wing tips, providing excellent all around coverage.  These phasers are rated at 1.3 MW and have an effective range of 75,000 kilometers.  An up-rated cooling system and a secondary phaser power coupling allow the Avenger's wing phasers, which are usually saved for point-defense, to provide continuous covering fire throughout even long battles.  Each "strip" can engage up to two targets at once.</para>
      <para>There are also four forward firing type VIII pulse-fire phaser cannons, concentrated into the nose of the Avenger.  These phasers are rated at 2.6 MW and have a range of 150,000 kilometers, but to be most effective are usually saved for close range passes.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Torpedo Systems</title>
      <para>To round out the Avenger's armament, two standard torpedo tubes were included into the design.  They are capable of firing one torpedo every two seconds, which means a staggered firing pattern launches one torpedo every second.  The MARS combat computer can simultaneously track and compute firing and evasive-fire solutions on over a dozen targets, allowing the Avenger to engage multiple targets at once while proving a very difficult target for other vessels fire-control computers to lock onto.  The standard torpedo load-out is 40 torpedoes, and includes both photon and quantum torpedoes.  Additional tri-cobalt devices can be launched when used with a standard torpedo casing.  The photon and quantum torpedoes have an effective range of 350,000 kilometers.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Firefly MIWS Torpedo</title>
      <para>The Avenger is also the first starship to employ the new Firefly MIWS torpedo, which is a modified type VI torpedo with the warhead and guidance systems removed.  In their place a ripple-fire micro-torpedo launching system is installed, firing a burst of twenty micro-torpedoes in under five seconds.  Each micro-torpedo is guided by the MARS combat computer after release, and allows the Avenger to engage multiple targets or hit multiple shields on a single target at the same time.  Two Firefly's could be launched releasing forty micro-torpedoes after a single target, or a group of targets.  Micro-torpedoes are not as effective as normal torpedoes, but can be used to temporarily blind or confuse an enemy if detonated close enough.  The Firefly torpedo can be launched up to ranges of 125,000 kilometers and be programmed to release the micro torpedoes at any point in it's flight-path.  The micro torpedoes have an additional range of 75,000 kilometers after being released, allowing a Firefly to be fired at a target 200,000 kilometers from the launching ship.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Command and Support Systems</title>
    <section>
      <title>Evacuation/Abandon Ship</title>
      <para>Evacuation of the Avenger Class is achieved through one of two means:  If the ships two transporters located on deck six would be used, evacuation of the ships maximum compliment would take approximately four and a half minutes.  If a suitable transport site is unavailable, the ships forty life-boats would be used.  Each lifeboat can support three people for eighty-six days.  By linking two or more life-boats together, the evacuees can conserve their supplies and extend their support period to 108 days or more.  Evacuating the ships maximum compliment in life-boats would take approximately two minutes.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Self Destruct Systems</title>
      <para>Self-Destruction of the Avenger Class is achieved by several ordinance packages located at key positions throughout the ship, in concert with the simultaneous release of both matter and anti-matter stores.  The computer is programed to provide a four minute countdown upon receiving the proper command-authorization.  The sequence can be aborted at any time up to the T-10 second mark, after which there is no way to abort the countdown.  At T-10 seconds, the ordinance packages are armed and primed for detonation.  At T-5 seconds the IPS safeties are released and the fusion reactions build uncontrollably, until at T-0 seconds the reactors overload.  Also at T-0 seconds, the matter/anti-matter loads are released and the ordinance packages are detonated.  The resulting explosion is equivalent to 250 photon torpedoes detonated simultaneously.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Main Bridge</title>
      <para>The main bridge of the Avenger Class is embedded into deck 1 of the ships hull.  It serves as the command hub of the vessel during normal and combat flight modes.  The main bridge contains helm/navigation, operations, tactical/communications, damage control, mission operations/scientific and engineering/environmental stations.  The main bridge has a small ready room and conference room (6 seats) adjacent to it.</para>
      <para>The bridge layout is similar to that of the Defiant Class, except the aft conference table has been placed behind a bulkhead.  The dual tactical stations were kept during the Dominion war, but one has now been converted to a full science station.  Emergency kick-out panels are located on the port and starboard sides of the bridge, and lead to jefferies tubes and escape trunks.  Emergency environmental suits are located in an equipment locker along the aft bulkhead.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Main Engineering</title>
      <para>The engineering section of the Avenger Class is the most unique in the fleet.  The warp core runs horizontally through the ship, hugging the ceiling on the main engineering deck with the power transfer conduits running port and starboard into the wings on either side of the hull.  The way the core is aligned, it ejects aft right below the tail where the impulse engines are housed.  This design is rather unconventional, but was necessary to facilitate the installation of a core that is too large for the Avenger's hull.</para>
      <para>The upper engineering deck provides access to the impulse engines, housed in the ship's tail.  The lowest engineering deck serves as a repair and monitor area.  Several dedicated offices and maintenance shops provide work space, while a large component replicator allows the fabrication of replacement parts.  All engineering spaces are located along the vessels center line, providing the maximum amount of protection for the ships vital systems.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Security Section</title>
      <para>The ship's security section is located on deck 5.  There are two detention cells, each capable of housing two prisoners at one time.  A wardroom/messroom is included for security staff, which has a large wall display showing a cut-away view of the ship with the current security status.  Each cell has a double bunk, water closet and sink and is isolated by it's own forcefield.  The "exercise corridor" provides access to each cell and is also isolated by a forcefield.  The security section also houses the ships armory, which is equipped with a wide range of weapons for various tasks.  Stores range from hand phasers and rifles to photon-mortar launchers and solid shot combat rifles.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Science Laboratory</title>
      <para>The Avenger is equipped with one general-purpose laboratory, which can handle most astronomical, geological or biological studies that may be necessary.  The lab is unfinished, with extra ODN and EPS taps throughout.  This makes it easy to modify should the crew need a more specialized lab and facilitates the addition of extra equipment.</para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Utility Systems</title>
    <section>
      <title>Cargo Bays</title>
      <para>The Avenger Class was designed to operate away from bases and supply stations for extended periods of up to 18 months.  As such it's cargo bays can carry 2,500 metric tonnes of cargo which is divided into two bays.  Cargo bays A and B each can store 1,250 mt and are each equipped small cargo transporters and have external bay doors.  They are capable of servicing the various sensor arrays located in pallets along the hull.  Each cargo bay is outfitted with EPS and ODN connections for quick modifications in the event the crew needs additional work space, a larger sickbay or a better equipped science lab.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Tractor Beam Systems</title>
      <para>There are several tractor beam emitters located around the ship.  The main emitter is located on the ships belly and is capable of holding a 250,000 metric tonne object at a range of less then 1,000 meters.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Transporter Systems</title>
      <para>There are 2 standard 6-person transporters located on deck 5.  They have a maximum range of 40,000 kilometers because of a high resolution transporter buffer.  All the ships cargo transporters (2 small cargo) also have a range of 40,000 kilometers.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Power Generation</title>
      <para>The Avenger Class starships employ several means of providing power for the vessels systems and engines:</para>
      <simplelist>
        <member>Primary power is generated by the ships M/ARA, which is also responsible for powering the vessels warp drives.</member>
        <member>Secondary power is provided by the impulse fusion reactors, which can provide power to the entire vessel for extended periods.</member>
        <member>Tertiary power is generated by a backup fusion reactor system, providing power to critical systems such as life-support, tactical and propulsion.  The tertiary reactor can provide limited impulse maneuvering by directing a stream of hydrogen gas through the reactor and venting the exhaust through the impulse engines.  Maximum speed is estimated at 0.11c.</member>
        <member>Quaternary power is provided by a series of storage cells, batteries and solar collectors which can provide life-support and ultra-critical systems power for a couple of days.  If used sparingly by diverting power only to emergency shelter areas, life-support can be maintained for several days.</member>
      </simplelist>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Crew Support Systems</title>
    <section>
      <title>Sickbay</title>
      <para>Sickbay is located on deck 5.  It is divided into two major sections.  The first contains the examination/emergency room (3 beds) in a single operating/main diagnostic area.  The second houses the ships medical storage area and bio-lab.  Both areas are equipped with holo-emitters and can support an EMH.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Emergency Equipment</title>
      <para>The Avenger Class starships are equipped with several emergency support systems.  These include the standard emergency pressure garments (which can support 1 person for up to 2 hours) and emergency medical/survival kits (which can support 6 people for up to 3 days) located behind access panels in every corridor.  Additional equipment includes emergency section support modules (which can provide life-support for 30 minutes) and manual firefighting equipment (employing an Aqueous Form Fitting Foam, or AFFF system) which are both located behind clearly labeled panels in each section of the ship.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Variable Environmental Systems</title>
      <para>Several areas of the ship are capable of supporting environments other than standard class-M.  One of these locations is the ships cargo bays.  Each bay has independent environmental controls which allow the environment to be changed in terms of atmosphere, pressure, gravity and temperature.  Class H, K, L, M, N or N(2) environments can be recreated in the ships cargo bays, and allows the Avenger to serve as a diplomatic courier or a host to conferences.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Crew Quarters</title>
      <para>Due to space constraints, crew quarters are fairly small and cramped at only thirty square meters.  Two persons of grades Junior-Lieutenant and below share a single room.  A single washroom is shared between two quarters (four persons) containing a sonic shower/tub with Jacuzzi unit, two water closets and two sinks.  Quarters are sparsely furnished featuring two standard twin size beds in a bunk-like configuration along one wall.  Two lounge chairs and a desk with library computer access provide some living space.  All crew quarters have access to ship's services such as intercoms, but there are no replicators due to the small size.  Instead one mess room provides replicators for the crew.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Officers Quarters</title>
      <para>Officers quarters are similar to crew quarters, except contain only a single standard twin size bed, two lounge chairs and a desk with library computer access.  A single washroom is shared between two quarters (two persons) and includes a sonic shower/tub with Jacuzzi unit, a single water closet and a single sink.  The ship's CO and XO have private washroom facilities.  Each officers quarters includes office space and a direct link with the ships computer core.  All officers quarters have access to ship's services such as intercoms, but there are no replicators due to the small size.  Instead an officers mess room provides replicators for officers.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>VIP Quarters</title>
      <para>The four VIP quarters are located on the same deck as the officers quarters.  They are arranged similarly to the CO and XO's cabins in that they are equipped with private washroom facilities.  VIP quarters also have variable atmospheric systems, and are capable of supporting class H, K, L, M, N and N(2) environments.  VIP quarters are located back-to-back and can easily be linked to form two large ambassadorial quarters.  When not in use the VIP quarters can be used as storage rooms or house additional crew members.  Like all crew and officers quarters, there are no replicators present in the VIP quarters.  Instead VIP's are usually served in the officers mess and dine with the ship's command staff.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Crew's Mess Room</title>
      <para>The mess room provides food replicators for the crew and gives them a place to meet for a friendly game of three dimensional chess.  Four replicator terminals are built into the mess room's forward bulkhead and can provide a wide selection of foods from many different worlds.  There are two entrances located on the port and starboard sides and two large bench-like tables.  Each table can seat twelve people at a time comfortably, though more can be squeezed in during a pinch.  Due to the positioning of the mess room in the hull there are no windows, though several LCARS displays provide a means of entertainment.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Officer's Mess Room</title>
      <para>The officers mess room is located on deck four, and is almost a carbon copy of the crews mess room.  The only major difference is the single twelve-person table positioned in the center of the room.  The officers mess room often is used as a conference room for larger scale meetings when the small conference area located off the bridge is not sufficient.  A larger LCARS display dominates the aft bulkhead and can be configured to display a variety of images.</para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Auxiliary Spacecraft Systems</title>
    <para>The Avenger is only equipped with two shuttlecraft, each operating out of a separate landing bay.  Each landing bay also serves as a service bay for the shuttlecraft or the various sensor equipment onboard.  Shuttlecraft up to ten meters in length and six meters in width can be supported from the landing bays.  Below is a list of small-craft that could be employed on Avenger class starships.  Only those craft meeting the size restrictions of the Avenger's landing bay are listed. Small-craft exceeding these restrictions are not listed, even if they could be carried externally beneath the hull.</para>

    <para>The Avenger is equipped with a generic docking collar at airlock 5, located on the ventral hull of the ship.  The docking clamps can be used to carry small craft at speeds up to warp 6, providing the docked vessel does not exceed the size of a runabout.  This allows the Avenger to carry additional equipment and engage in forced boarding operations.  The Avenger can also dock with larger vessels for high warp flight, provided both vessels are equipped with docking ports and their engines are slaved together.</para>
