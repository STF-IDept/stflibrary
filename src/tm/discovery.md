History and Mission Overview
============================

After the Dominion War, several members of Star Fleet Science felt that
Star Fleet was losing focus of its science mission. They successfully
lobbied to begin R & D into a new generation long-range science vessel.
After recovery of the Prometheus in 2374, it was decided to use a
modified design as a basis for the new class. The primary and secondary
hull we're left as a single unit, changing the three-stage separation to
a two stage. Do to its role as a science vessel, 10 phaser arrays and
one torpedo tube were removed. This exchange allowed ample room for the
addition of science labs and conference rooms. Most notable is the
addition of two interchangeable mission modules: One in the primary hull
and one in the secondary. These modules can be changed according to the
ships mission. The ship is also equipped for a planetary landing should
such be warranted and necessary.

The designers opted to keep several key advancements. The quad nacelle
and the MARA Mark II Dual-Split Prototype were kept. This design allows
both the primary and secondary hulls to remain warp capable during a
separation. They also kept the holo-emitters placed throughout the ship.
Placement of the holo-emitters throughout the ship allows the upgraded
EMH (Mark IV) access to the entire ship in the event of a medical
emergency and no medics were available.

One final addition was the conference rooms. This allows the class to
also be utilized for diplomatic missions. It may be utilized in both a
courier and/or hosting capacity.

Structure and Construction
==========================

The Discovery, like the Prometheus, is a hybrid of the Intrepid and
Sovereign classes. It utilizes a quad-nacelle design allowing the
primary and secondary hulls to both remain warp capable during a
separation. The separation occurs between decks 7 and 8. The nacelles
are similar in design to the Sovereign class. The rest of the frame is
based on the Intrepid class with one exception; the "saucer" section is
more triangular in shape; not quite as much as the Prometheus, however.

The ships contain a double hull constructed of heavy duranium/tritanium
alloy. It also contains a high-level structural integrity field. The
ships have 13 decks and come equipped with landing struts should a
planetary landing be necessary. The secondary hull is capable of a
planetary landing during a separation.

Mission Modules
---------------

The class is equipped with interchangeable modules on decks 2 and 12
with the capability of being changed at a starbase. Several modules have
been developed to enhance the ships effectiveness in different missions.

"Standard module" -- contains systems that are not required for a
specific mission, hence the name 'Standard', such as two Type X phaser
banks per module (one ventral, one dorsal), additional crew quarters,
and additional sensory and communication pallets.

"Diplomatic Mission Modules" --- The Discovery Class has a Federation
diplomatic rating of 4. Although any star ship can be transformed into a
diplomatic vessel, the Discovery class can be re-fitted with the
Diplomatic Modules. These modules include, additional staff quarters,
independent communications facilities, facilities for up to 50 members
of the press, and a conference hall for 450 guests. The addition of the
modules would also require an adjustment to existing diplomatic
facilities. The conversion would raise the diplomatic rating of the
class to 5 and final specs would be as follows:

20 - Ambassadorial quarters at 100 square meters each
400 - Staff quarters at 15 square meters each
1 - 1,000 square meter conference hall complexes for 450 guests
20 - 90 square meter 25 seat-briefing rooms
20 - Independent communications facilities
15% of all facilities, including interconnecting corridors, capable of
supporting H, K, or L environments
Facilities for up to 50 members of the press
The addition of the diplomatic modules requires both module sections to
be utilized; hence no other module can be used in conjunction.

"Medical Mission Module" -- When in construction, Lt.Cmdr Mackael
Stockhausen thought about a 'Medical Emergency' or Evacuation plan. The
Medical Module could transform a portion of the ship into a medical
response team. Two additional sickbays could be added; another Emergency
Medical Hologram would be added. Due to the extreme circumstances under
which this module would be utilized, however, the module EMH would be
restricted to the module sickbays. In order to accommodate the
possibility of a planetary evacuation, the medical module facilities
include extra equipment for xeno-biology.

"Advanced Science Module" -- This module provides the Discovery with the
ability to perform deep space exploration and mapping. Additional
science labs, such as Xenobiology, Exobiology, Stellar Cartography,
Astrometrics, etc., along with additional sensor arrays come standard
with this module.

Additional modules may be created if a need arise for a specific
mission.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems
==================================

The Discovery Class contains a bio/neural gel pack computer system
network with LCARS 3.1 interface. It has 2000 dedicated modules, a data
transfer rate of 7500 kilo quads/sec, and a total storage capacity of
852,000 module/module.

The class also contains an advanced version of the Mark IV Emergency
Medical Hologram. The modified EMH Mark IV is capable of responding
anywhere in the ship due to strategic placement of holo-emitters
throughout all habitable portions of the ship with exception of Jeffries
tubes.

Warp Propulsion Systems
=======================

The class is equipped with dual M/ARA warp cores each feeding two
nacelles, one located on decks 4 through 6 and one on decks 9 through
11. This setup provides for both the primary hull and secondary hull to
remain warp capable during a separation. This design gives both sections
the capability of a cruising velocity of Warp 7.25, maximum sustainable
velocity warp 8.6, and a maximum velocity of warp 9.8 for 12 hours. When
not separated, only one warp system will be active, while the other is
kept in cold standby. Should the ship be brought to yellow or red alert
the system will be brought automatically to hot standby in anticipation
of a separation or of damage to the active system. The time from cold to
hot standby is ten minutes.

The Discovery is equipped with a quad-nacelle design. The nacelles are
similar to the Sovereign class in design and are of variable geometry.
When not at warp, the four nacelles give the appearance of 2 large
nacelles, extending out along the horizontal axis of the ship. When at
warp, the nacelles are at a 30-degree angle from the horizontal axis.
The 30-degree angle is not static, however, as minor adjustments in
angle may be necessary during warp travel. The computer handles all
adjustments automatically, keeping the angle at the optimum setting for
the particular area of space.

Impulse Propulsion Systems
==========================

The class contains the standard impulse drive system. It contains 16
fusion generators feeding four impulse engines. There are 2 impulse
engines located on deck 3 and 2 on deck 11. The impulse engines propel
the class to a maximum of 0.27c.

Tactical Systems
================

The Discovery class employs a standard shield system with a total
dissipation rate of 2.43x10\^5 kW. It also is equipped with metaphasic
shielding for use in areas with especially high solar radiation. It also
contains 400 type-10 phaser emitters (50 emitters per array) with a
total output 5.0 MW. There are 2 arrays located on the ventral section
and 2 located on the dorsal section. The other four are only exposed
during times of separation, allowing each section to retain 360-degree
phaser coverage. Finally, the class carries a standard compliment of 200
torpedoes feeding 4 tubes. There are 2 forward, one on deck 4 and one on
deck 9, and 2 aft, one on deck 7 and one on deck 11. The four-tube
system provides for complete protection during a separation.

Command and Support Systems
===========================

Bridge
------

The bridge is situated in the center of deck one. It is modular as to
facilitate upgrades in space dock as needed. A visual representation of
the bridge can be found below.

Utility Systems
===============

Cargo Bays
----------

The Discovery contains 5 cargo bays located as follows: 2 on deck 6, 2
on deck 12, and one auxiliary on deck 13. All cargo bays are on the
interior of the ship and therefore are not directly accessible to the
exterior of the ship without the use of transporters.

Tractor Beam Systems
--------------------

The Main Tractor beam is located on deck 13 and the secondary is on deck
6. Both have a maximum range of 500,000 km.

Transporter Systems
-------------------

The class also contains 4 transporter rooms each with a range of 40,000
km. The transporter rooms are located as follows: Two on deck 3 and two
on deck 8.

Crew Support Systems
====================

Diplomatic Systems
------------------

The class carries a diplomatic rating of 4. In accordance with
Federation standards, the class is equipped with 5 Ambassadorial
quarters, 50 staff quarters, 1 conference hall, 5 Briefing rooms, and
one independent communications facility.

Alternate Enviornment
---------------------

The VIP Quarters, Conferences rooms, Briefing rooms, Communication
facility, and adjoining hallways on deck three have been equipped to
provide an H or K environment to suit the needs of the diplomats that
may come aboard.

Holodeck
--------

The Discovery Class has the most advanced holo-technology in Star-Fleet.
Two main holodecks for crew use are installed. These holodecks are
standard size, which is two decks tall. The Discovery is also equipped
with a holo-engineering facility used for Scientific and Medical work
only. The holo-engineering systems are mainly used for scientific
purposes, so that the primary holodecks are not being used for
Star-Fleet Science work.

Starfleet has spent time on working on ways to improve Holodeck safety.
Research has shown 'Holo addiction' and 'Safety Protocol Deactivation'
has been a high risk factor. This has led to an improved safety
protocol.

Holo-Addiction Protocol Zeta Nine - A New piece of 'Software' which is
embedded within the Primary and Secondary Holodeck systems. This
software is set to shut down the holodeck when the desired program has
been running for a maximum of 8 hours. The protocol will shut down the
holodeck, save any relevant data, and open the holodeck doors.

Safety Protocols - The Standard Safety Protocols have been shown to have
flaws in the design. The new protocol will reengage after 5 minutes, if
the program has a bug in it's coding, or if the holodeck/ship has
experienced damage. Two Command level officers, XO or above, and an
override code are required to deactivate the Safety Protocols.

VIP Quarters
------------

The VIP quarters contain LCARS terminal, communications display and
conference desk, one queen-sized bed, three leather chairs, and a
replicator similar to the design on the bridge. The quarters, along with
a portion of the deck and the conference rooms, have been equipped to
provide an H or K environment to suit the needs of the diplomats that
may come aboard.

Sickbay
-------

The sickbay is one of the advanced systems on the Discovery. Within the
sickbay a total of five biobeds are available, and three emergency
biobeds can be constructed within a matter of minutes. Five medical
LCARS terminals are within the Sickbay, along with three different
surgical beds.

The Chief Medical Officer's Office is separated off to the side of the
main sickbay; it consists of one chair, desk, replicator and LCARS
Interface.

Crew Lounge
-----------

The Crew lounge, Nine Forward, is a recreational area for the crew when
off duty, the lounge itself is pointed towards the front of the ship,
giving a peaceful environment to the lounge. It has a compliment of 12
tables and 25 chairs, 12 bar stools and a bar that occupies the left
side of the lounge, approximately 8 meters in length.

Auxiliary Spacecraft Systems
============================

The Discovery class carries a compliment of 4 Type 12 personnel shuttles
and 2 Valhalla class Runabouts located in the main shuttle bay. The main
shuttle bay encompasses 2 decks and is to the rear of the ship on decks
8 and 9.
