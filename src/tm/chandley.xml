    <title>History and Mission Overview</title>
    <para>In 2368 Starfleet was still recovering from the after-effects of the Battle of Wolf 359. While rebuilding of its major exploration and defense ships was still in the works, Starfleet began to realize it required a more adaptive approach to many core designs. One, a venerable cruiser design from the late 23rd century which had been refit in the mid-2350s, was still a strong, viable design in the waning months of 2368. Starfleet decided to once again refit the Chandley-class heavy cruiser with newer technologies just now coming online.</para>
    <para>The design of the refit took longer than expected, and was eventually halted during the Dominion War. After the war's end in 2375, work resumed on the refits of the Chandley-class. Within a few months, the first of these refitted cruisers, the USS Albert Einstein, was launched with fully updated systems.</para>
    <para>After its launch, the Albert Einstein was given to Starfleet Academy for a shakedown cruise. Its shakedown crew consisted of a handful of senior Academy training officers, the Academy's Red Squadron, and some senior Cadets. While on its maiden voyage, the ship was apparently lost with all hands near the Romulan Neutral Zone. No trace of the ship or her crew was ever found. The accident resulted in a halt to the refitting program while a Board of Inquiry investigated the Einstein's disappearance. After the Board determined there was no fault in the design, refitting resumed in late 2376, resulting in all remaining Chandley-class cruisers returning to service by 2378.</para>

    <title>Ships of the Class</title>
    <para>Ships of the Chandley-class, have a varied naming history. The earliest ones held names related to lesser known explorers, and families from earth's history. The second batch of built Chandleys in 2350's refit were named traditionally for minor inventors, families, and colonies around Federation space. The present refit Chandleys of the late 2370s however, though having few newer ships built at construction yards, are named for inventors and scientists of Earth's history, as well as small lakes and seas of colony worlds around Federation space. Because of this long service life, and from losses over the years, few older designs remain in service. As a result, it has created a varied registry list.</para>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <para>With the refit of 2375, the Chandley class heavy cruiser went from a secondary line vessel back to a hard working front line heavy cruiser. It is capable of a variety of mission profiles for within and beyond Federation space. Its refit has ensured a further long life of an already long-serving class of ships.</para>
