  : Primary Vessels

Mission Profile
===============

All ships are either Primary Vessels, or Support Vessels (See Below).
All Primary Vessels have one of three (3) Primary Missions:

Science
:   Study in depth cool stuff that someone else found; conduct
    experiments; study natural and artificial phenomenon.

Exploration
:   Find new cool stuff; chart out new areas of space; seak out new life
    and new civilizations; To Boldly Go Where No Man Has Gone Before;
    Command; Diplomatic escort; Diplomatic conduct; Patrol; and various
    and sundry other general purpose stuff.

Combat
:   Blow stuff up; Keep stuff from being blown up; Patrol to keep out
    other people who may want to blow stuff up; Help other ships blow
    stuff up; Protect other ships that are trying to blow stuff up.

Support Vessels have the Primary Mission of assisting other ships in
fulfilling their Primary Mission.

Vessel Size
===========

Primary Vessels also come in three convienent sizes; Small, Large, and
Super Sized. (No, wait, that's french fries. Starships come in Small,
Medium, and Large.)

The size of a ship is determined by its standard crew complement. A
class that is close to the borderline between two size classifications
may be placed in either size classification as determined by the
Engineering Department.

Vessels with a standard crew complement of 175 or less are classified as
Small.
Vessels with a standard crew complement of 175 to 600 are classified as
Medium.
Vessels with a standard crew complement of 600 or larger are classified
as Large.
Vessels with a standard crew compliment of over 1000 are considered
friggin' HUGE, but are still classified as Large.
Category
========

Each Mission Type can come in each size, for a total of 9 Categories.
(Support Vessels are listed separately.) Each Category has a name
associated with it. The table of active Categories is listed above.
Therefore, a "Small Vessel designed primarily for Combat" is a
Destroyer, while a "Large Vessel designed primarily for Science" is a
Researcher.

Variant
=======

Each Category may come in a variety of Variants. A Variant is a
differentiation between two or more classes in the same Category. A
Variant label is prepended to the Category name of a vessel. A Variant
should properly describe the specific nature of the class in question
within the Category. For example:

The Trafalgar-class is a Small ship, designed primarily for Combat. It
is of the Tactical Variant. Therefore, the Trafalgar is a "Tactical
Destroyer."
The McCoy-class is a Small ship, designed primarily for missions within
the existing Federation sphere. It is of the Medical Variant. It is
therefore a "Medical Frigate."
Variant names are determined at design time by the designer and
Engineering Department. No explicit limit is imposed upon the number of
vessels within a Category, provided that they be sufficently unique to
warrant separate Variants. A ship lacking a Variant is considered to be
of the Variant "Medium." The currently active list of Variants words
contains:

Light
:   Containing a lower end mixture of systems or equipment for
    fulfilling a class's primary mission profile.

Medium
:   Containing a balanced mixture of systems or equipment for fulfilling
    a class's primary mission profile.

Heavy
:   Containing a higher end mixture of systems or equipment for
    fulfilling a class's primary mission profile.

Tactical
:   Containing a higher end mixture of combat and defensive systems or
    equipment for fulfilling combat oriented mission profiles.

Medical
:   Containing highly specialized systems or equipment for the sole
    purpose of more medical oriented mission profiles.

This variant list is not exhaustive. Additional, customized variants may
be created with the approval of the Engineering Director, their
Assistant, or designated subordinate when reviewing a submitted ship
specification.

Support Vessels
===============

Support Vessels are any vessels whose Primary Mission is to assist other
Primary Vessels in fulfilling their Primary Mission. Under normal
circumstances they do not operate independently of other craft, either
of the same class or other classes. (In the STF context, these are
typically NPC vessels.) Support Vessels are defined by their Category.
The Category of a Support Vessel is determined at design time by the
designer and Engineering Department. Possible Categories of Support
Vessels include:

Small
:   Shuttles, Fighters, Travel Pods, small one man craft

Medium
:   Runabouts, Scouts, Escorts, medium sized ships and Small Capitol
    ships that don't fit in the above chart.

:   
Large
:   Freighter, Tug/Transport, Carrier, Large Capitol Ships that don't
    fit in the above chart.

This list is not intended to be exhaustive.

Sign Off
========

Assistant Engineering Director Larry Garfield, Engineering Advisor
Israel Harris, and Dockmaster Randy E. McCullick met on May 20, 2000 in
the parking lot of County Stadium, Milwalkee, Wisconson, USA. The
Izzy-Mobile served as a support structure (table) for the preliminary
draft. The County Stadium Compromise was the combination of the Garfield
and McCullick Spec Category Systems, to form The Milwaukee Plan.
