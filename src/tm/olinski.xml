    <title>History and Mission Overview</title>
    <epigraph>
      <para>"I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely seas and the sky." *</para>
    </epigraph>
    <para>Following the Dominion War, many in the Federation felt that Starfleet had created combat ships for too long. In spite of a call for more vessels focused upon the Federation's stated mission of exploration and interplanetary cooperation, some military leaders feared that disarmament might once again leave the Federation vulnerable. Starfleet's Admiralty Board proposed a compromise. Along with many scientific vessel designs, one large combat vessel would see approval, provided that it could take the place of multiple smaller combat-oriented vessels. With this in mind, the design, initially called the Andoria class, was specifically built to counter any enemies that the Federation might meet.</para>
    <para>The design phase was accelerated, stealing some ideas from other vessels in order to allow the full design to be completed in only seven years. After five years of design, the first vessel began construction at the McKinley Yards orbiting Earth. While they were not Starfleet's first choice for making the newest generation of super-ships, the Yards were relatively underused at the time, allowing the ship of the class to be completed in an astounding eight years. After two months of round-the-clock testing during its shakedown run, the ship class was ready for commission.</para>
    <para>The death of Brian Olinski led the designers to name the ship class after him as a memorial to his exemplary service.</para>

    <title>Structure and Construction</title>
    <epigraph>
      <para>"And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by." *</para>
    </epigraph>
    <para>For the Brian Olinski, the designers felt that a dish-type section with two nacelles was appropriate. This was mostly because such a large vessel would cause less damage to subspace if it were a single hull, and because construction could be accelerated with a streamlined hull design.</para>
    <para>The "dish" is a diamond-style arrowhead shape, with the aft triangle being two-thirds the size of the forward triangle, if the aft triangle were allowed to run its full length. However, the aft point is aborted, replaced by a flat surface. The two nacelles are on the ventral side, each 200 meters from the midline, and the pylons on the nacelles sit on a sixty-degree angle. One-third of each nacelle is beneath the dish, while the rest of the length extends behind it. The nacelles are not included in the deck count.</para>
    <para>Each of decks 2 to 29 increase in width and length compared to the previous deck, while each of decks 30 to 40 decrease in width and length compared the the previous deck. On decks 37 through 39, there is a wide opening in the hull, allowing access to the the fighter hangar. Two more smaller forward openings run from deck 31 to 33, and allow access to the shuttle bays. All of the openings have exterior drop-down doors.</para>
    <para>The deflector dish is on the dorsal fore of the ship. It is circular in shape, and is posi-tioned on a vertical inset in the hull. It stretches from decks 26 to 29.</para>
    <para>For most of the ship's superstructure and external shell, the shipyards utilized regular welding and assembly techniques. However, once most of this was finished, the yards used transporter welding to finish the rest of the ship, which accounted for the fast build time.</para>
    <para>The hull is a tritanium superstructure with tritanium/duranium supports and titanium internal roofing, flooring, and walls. This allows the ship's main hard points to withstand more force, as pure tritanium has been found to be more durable - albeit more difficult to acquire - than the alloy. A typical tritanium/duranium/insulation layer forms the external shell. The ship has 2 cm of ablative armor covering the entirety of the vessel.</para>

      <title>Sensors</title>
      <para>The ship has type-VIII sensors, with a high-resolution range of 3.8 light years and a low-resolution range of 12.3 light years.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Computer Cores</title>
      <para>To provide multiple redundancies in the system, should combat result in computer sys-tem damage, the Brian Olinski is equipped with five isolinear cores. There is a central-ized core four decks high, running from decks 19 to 22. Two other cores are forward, three decks high, and go from decks 16 to 18, on port and starboard sides of the ship. The final two cores are in the aft of the ship, on decks 24 to 26, close together, so that they can share coolant sources. The entire computer grid is also isolinear, and is capa-ble of segmenting itself in the event of electronic sabotage. The system is the seventh-generation LCARS Operating System with the MAJEL interface.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Sickbay Computers</title>
      <para>The two Sickbays are each equipped with two EMH Mark IV variants. Due to complaints from other EMH iterations that they did not appreciate having the same appearance as countless other programs, Starfleet Research and Development has implemented new programming to make each EMH seem more unique. As such, none of the EMH programs share any similarities in appearance, although they all share the same medical database.</para>
      <para>In the Upper Sickbay, they are designated as EMH White and EMH Blue, and in the Lower Sickbay, they are designated as EMH Green and EMH Gold. They are activated by color coding - e.g. "Computer, activate Blue." - instead of simply telling the computer to activate an EMH, and have colored bands around the cuffs of their uniforms to differentiate them. They are customized, so that Blue and Gold are female, while White and Green are male. The EMHs in the Lower Sickbay are more brief in their speech, but not to the point of impersonality. They are all designated as possessing the same rank and authority. They are present so that the regular medical staff can have extra assistance during triage, and as temporary replacements to multiple medical personnel.</para>
      <para>However, should they be required to replace the entire Medical staff aboard the ship, there is also a fifth EMH Mark IV which is not specific to either Sickbay. It activates on the command, "Activate Primary EMH." In order to differentiate it from the other EMH programs, it has the <link linkend="swede">SWEDE</link> upgrade installed, and has authority over the other four in any and all situations. Because of the primary EMH, all of the other EMH's are programmed to understand gibberish.</para>

    <title>Warp Propulsion Systems</title>
    <epigraph>
      <para>"And a gray mist on the sea's face, and a gray dawn breaking." *</para>
    </epigraph>
    <para>The ship utilizes a Class VII warp core powering two nacelles. It is five decks in height, from deck 26 to deck 30, with the main reaction chamber placed in the Main Level of Main Engineering on deck 28. It is capable of producing 1548 Cochranes, with a maxi-mum 12-hour speed of warp 9.5, a maximum sustainable speed of warp 7.2, and a standard cruising speed of warp 5.5. The nacelles are fixed-geometry. The Deuterium Storage Tanks, Fuel Pumps, Fill Ports, and Injector Reactors are on deck 25. The Anti-Matter Storage Tanks, Fuel Pumps, Fill Ports, and Injector Reactors are on deck 31.</para>
    <para>In the event that the warp core needs to be ejected, the ship has a tube running from deck 31 to a plated hole on the bottom exterior of deck 34, just forward of deck 35. The systems will unlatch the core from its hard points, explosive charges will detach the plate, and a hydraulic piston which is always attached to the top of the core will cause enough force for the core to shoot out of the hull at 10 km/second. The piston is located on decks 23 through 25.</para>

    <title>Impulse Propulsion Systems</title>
    <epigraph>
      <para>"I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide" *</para>
    </epigraph>
    <para>The ship has four impulse units, all mounted on the rear of the ship, two decks in height, and each powered by four fusion engines. The two upper units run from decks 10 to 11, with the fusion engines mounted and connected on those same decks, and the two lower units run from decks 24 to 25, with the same setup.</para>
    <para>The ship also has 300 extra thrusters on unused ship surfaces, which allow the ship to turn ninety degrees in 8 seconds without any forward motion. It reaches a maximum impulse of .25c. It can reach full impulse in 26 seconds, and due to the extra thrusters, it can come to a full stop in 30 seconds.</para>

      <para>"Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied." *</para>
    </epigraph>
    <section>
      <title>Defensive Shields</title>
      <para>The vessel, due to its size, has eight enhanced type-12 shield emitters - four on top and four on the bottom. The four dorsal emitters are on decks 6 and 7, spaced evenly around the dish. Two ventral emitters are on decks 33 and 34, and are on the port and starboard, while a further two are on decks 35 and 36, also on port and starboard, but farther forward on the hull. Combined, they provide a uniform field that can take a max-imum graviton load of 2688 MW, and which has a maximum energy dissipation rate of 7.3 x 10^5 kW.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Phaser Systems</title>
      <para>The Brian Olinski has a total of 7 type X phaser arrays - 4 dorsal and 3 ventral - as well as 2 type IX phaser banks. There is one phaser bank on the rear of each nacelle, with four emitters a piece. They all have a horizontal and vertical firing arcs of 180 degrees, a maximum energy output of 3.8 MW, and a maximum range of 225,000 km. Akin to the design of the Sovereign class, the 4 dorsal arrays and the 3 ventral arrays are grouped together to form most of a ring around the top and bottom of the dish section. The dor-sal array wraps around the top in a complete ring, while the ventral array stops just be-fore the nacelles. Each array in the rings has 250 emitters, a vertical arc of 150 degrees, a horizontal arc of 240 degrees, a maximum energy output of 5.1 MW, and a maximum range of 300,000 km.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Torpedo Systems</title>
      <para>The Brian Olinski has 5 main torpedo launchers total, each capable of firing 7 projectiles per sortie. Two are dorsal, on deck 25, evenly spaced along the forward part of those decks, and aiming forward. One is directly aft, on decks 20. The final two are on either side of the regular shuttle bays, on deck 32. They all have a maximum range of 350,000 km. The Brian Olinski carries a total of 300 casings. Of these, 60 are reserved as probes, 200 are Mark-V torpedoes, and 40 are Mark-VI torpedos. The torpedo and probe casings are stored in separate rooms on Deck 23.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Fighter Weapons Storage</title>
      <para>The Brian Olinski also holds 5,000 micro-torpedoes for the fighter craft aboard. These torpedoes are stored beneath the fighter hangar on deck 40, and have a dedicated ele-vator which takes them up to the flight deck. The torpedoes can be summoned via the elevator controls, and transfer to the elevator via rail systems.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Bridge</title>
      <para>The Bridge aboard the Brian Olinski comprises almost all of Deck 1, and is circular in basic structure, with a diameter of 11 meters. There are three basic levels, with the aft level being 0.4 meters higher than the forward level, and the third level being sunken in to the forward level.</para>
      <para>In the back of the forward level, there are two chairs - one for the CO, and one for the XO. The starboard chair is for the CO, as it has command controls specifically designed for the Captain. These chairs look directly at the main view screen on the front wall of the Bridge. To the aft port and aft starboard of these chairs are sets of two steps which allow access between the forward level and the aft level. Directly to port and starboard of these chairs are two turbolifts, both which lead to the Emergency Bridge.</para>
      <para>Directly forward of these chairs, sunken in by 0.2 meters and accessible by a single step, is the CONN station, which accesses helm and navigational controls for the ship. There is a single chair for the officer manning the CONN. To the port of the CONN, but on the same level as the CO and XO's chair, is the Flight Operations station. This sta-tion provides a direct tactical link between the Combat Information Center (CIC) and the Bridge, and allows for the CAG and the CO to share information between each other about the status of auxiliary craft and the main vessel. It has a chair in front of a single panel, as well as a wall display detailing information relayed from the CIC. An Operations officer typically mans this station. Directly across from this station, on the starboard side, is a Fleet Control station. During fleet actions, this station will relay information about other ships to the Brian Olinski-class vessel, including tactical plans, ship status, and current formation. Its physical arrangement is similar to that of Flight Operations. An Ops officer or a flag officer mans this station, which acts as a mission operations station during missions where an Brian Olinski-class operates alone.</para>
      <para>At the center of the aft level, there are two displays with a panel underneath, with two chairs at each display. The starboard display and panel includes the Master Systems Display and the Engineering station, which allows the Bridge to access all technical information from the ship. The port display and panel is the Science station, and allows the Bridge to access all information from the sensors, probes, and laboratories. To the port and starboard of these displays are doors which lead to a corridor directly aft of the displays. This corridor has a turbolift on a direct line to each door, as well as a stairwell in the center which goes to deck 2. Farther to the starboard of the displays is an alcove which is both the Tactical and Security station. The panel at the fore of the alcove com-prises all of the ship's tactical controls, from shield distribution to phaser fire. The rear of the alcove has three displays and one panel, and allows the individual at the station to access basic security information, current Brig status, and security staffing information. In a similar position on the port side is an alcove which is the Operations station. It has a similar setup, with a forward facing panel that displays all ship operations, and allows the individual at the station to allocate ship's operations according to priority and capability. The three displays and panel at the aft of this station offer the officer at this station a more detailed display of all operations, including pending, ongoing, and previously rejected operations.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Conference Room</title>
      <para>The Conference Room is where the senior command staff meets for mission briefings, mission updates, and other situation reports. It has a total of seventeen seats around a table, one at the head, and eight on each side. Typically, they would seat the CO, the XO, the CE, the CMO, the COS, the CSO, the Chief Operations Officer, the CAG, the Marine Commander, and, should the vessel require it, the Chief Tactical Officer, the Chief Intelligence Officer, and any command staff from other vessels in the fleet, as well as flag officers present during a fleet action. It is located beneath the Bridge on deck 2, and connects directly from the Bridge via stairwell. For security reasons, the stairs have soundproofed sliding doors at the deck 2 end. There are two turbolift access doors on either side of the stairs. To the starboard side of this room is the CO's office, and to the port side is the XO's office.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Emergency Bridge</title>
      <para>Starfleet designers prepared for all eventualities, and created this bridge to allow for the possibility of the Main Bridge's disabling or destruction. This is a more compact design, located on deck 22, with everything on the same level. The CO and XO's chairs are at the center, with the same placement, but more limited functionality. Ops and the CONN station are both at the fore of Bridge, with only a panel and a chair for each. Ops relays only combat-related information, and so also serves as an auxiliary Flight Operations station. These stations are offset from one another to allow the CO and XO to see the view screen on the front wall. Tactical is on a  centralized station directly aft of the CO and XO's chairs, and also serves as a security station. Aft of Tactical is the Master Sys-tems Display. To the starboard of the display is a simplified Engineering station, which has a chair, a single panel, and a wall display about 16 inches high. To the port of the Master Systems Display is a similarly simplified Science station with a layout similar to that of the Engineering station.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Intelligence Offices</title>
      <para>Located on deck 5, these are a set of three offices linked by a central lobby. Due to the fact that the Brian Olinski is designed to survive in hostile territory, these offices allow the vessel to possess more knowledge of certain situations than the average Starfleet vessel. These offices provide a direct uplink to Starfleet Intelligence, gaining the officers classified information at critical points. Each office is for an individual Intelligence officer, and has a desk, a table, and three chairs. The main lobby holds two tables, each of which has two work stations containing a touch screen, a private intercom, and dividing walls when needed, with junior Intelligence or Security officers using each station.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Security Offices</title>
      <para>Located on Deck 12, the Security Offices serve as the main area for all security officers. The only private office belongs to the COS. There are six tables, and each table serves a specific Security division. Table 1 serves shipboard patrols and general security, table 2 serves external security concerns - visiting personnel, for example - and hangar and shuttle bay security, table 3 serves possible shipboard crime, table 4 serves shipboard criminal investigations, table 5 serves mission critical investigations, and table 6 can serve as an expansion table for any of the other specific departments.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>COS' Office</title>
      <para>The COS' office is a large facility, with five displays for each of the work stations in the main offices. It also has a weapons locker, with room for two phaser rifles and two handheld phasers. There is a desk, four chairs, and a bench.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Brig</title>
      <para>The brig is located on deck 18. There are two cell blocks. The main cell block has six cells with two wall-mounted beds each. These cells have energy fields to contain the occupants. The secondary cell block has four cells, each of which is an isolation chamber. The cells have a single bed and a private area to handle matters of personal hygiene, and have a solid titanium door with an external-only lock, reinforced by a force field, to contain occupants. Sensors and three cameras monitor these occupants.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Armory</title>
      <para>The Armory is located on Deck 13, and is an extensive personnel weapons area. The weapons available are type-II hand held phasers, type-III phaser rifles, type-IIIa com-pression phaser rifles, tetryon pulse rifles, and mortar-style mark-I photon torpedo launchers. There are five lockers for each type of weapon. Barring the type-II phasers, which are ten per locker, there are four weapons per locker. Ammunition for the mark-I launchers is in the back of each launcher locker. Each locker also has six sets of ener-gy-dampening personal armor vests. The area is a restricted access location. The COS or the Marine Commander are at the lowest level of authorization for the Armory, with the XO and the CO being the only other individuals that can grant access to the room.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Weapons Lockers</title>
      <para>Outside of the Armory, each deck from deck 5 to deck 37 - except for deck 13 - has three self-contained weapons lockers that are smaller than the lockers in the armory. They are on inserts in the corridor walls, with access panels that look like wall decoration to anybody that is not trained in their use. They have a biometric access key combined with a numeric data input, meaning that an individual's fingerprint is scanned when inputting the code, and a retinal scan then confirms the identity of the individual wishing to access the locker. When the ship is not at alert, only the people granted ac-cess to the Armory are able to access these lockers. When the ship goes to yellow alert, all officer-level personnel may access these lockers. When the ship is on red alert, all military personnel listed in the ship's database can access the lockers, and the lockers only need to pass the first level of security to open the lockers. Each locker has two type-III phaser rifles and four type-II hand-held phasers.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Engineering</title>
      <para>Located on decks 27 through 29, Engineering is divided in to three levels - upper, main, and lower - and is centralized around the warp core reaction chamber. The warp core itself is central to Engineering, with the rest of Engineering arranged around it in a mostly rectangular fashion. The main entrance to Engineering is on the starboard side of deck 28. The main entrance leads to a central control area on the main level. It is a seven-by-ten-meter area that has an open side that goes to the rest of Engineering and provides a view of the main reaction chamber. The control area has with two tables, and two display panels on each of the walls. The table closest to the entrance displays information on all tactical systems. The table closer to the core displays information on all command systems. The forward wall panels display science and computer systems. The aft wall panels display crew support and utility systems. The tables and the panels are all interactive touch screens.</para>
      <para>The flooring around the warp core on the main and upper levels are titanium grating. Ladders on the port and starboard sides can be used to access the lower level, while stairwells on the fore and aft ends allow access to the upper level. The lower level has all of the remote manual override access panels on the ship, while the upper level has all of the direct controls for propulsion systems operations, including the warp core, warp nacelles, and impulse engines. The upper and main decks can be used to access the Jeffries' tubes, while the lower deck is reduced in height to allow access to the cen-tral cabling junctions of the isolinear optical data network, which run underneath solid plating that forms the floor of the lower level.</para>
      <para>On the port side of Engineering's main level is a secondary entrance leads to a corridor that provides access to the Chief Engineer's office.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>CE's Office</title>
      <para>The Chief Engineer's Office is directly connected to the main level of Engineering, and is lined with information on the vital systems of the ship. It has a desk and three chairs. The desk has a panel which controls the layout of the displays on the walls, and allows the Chief Engineer or the Lead Engineer on Duty to make slight modifications to any system on the ship.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Science Labs</title>
      <para>The Science Labs are located on deck 15, and each one serves a different purpose. There are labs for physics, chemistry, and biology - as well as one lab for general or mission specific use. Access to the labs is through the general lab. Each lab has its own room. All of them are connected in a square pattern. Detailed sensor readouts can be accessed here, as well as any data from probes.</para>
      <para>The physics lab is connected to the chemisty and general labs has three stations and two wall displays. The first station is a holographic display with full capabilities, including providing simulations of mass, density, viscosity, pressure, velocity, force, and energy. There is a control panel on all four sides of the station, allowing multiple officers to add or remove aspects of the simulation without much delay time. The second station is for theoretical work, and is lower than the first station. It has four seats, each of which has a touch screen work station in front of it. It is capable of displaying more aspects than the holographic display, as it allows people to work in four dimensions using two-dimensional display methods. The wall displays are for atomic analysis results. The third station is on the wall, and is a communications station, allowing information sharing between the labs, as well as to gain information from the sensors and probes.</para>
      <para>The chemistry lab is connected to the physics and biology labs, and has four stations. The first station is a computer-run chemical analyzer. The second station is a theoretical workstation akin to the one in the physics lab, but specialized for chemistry. The third station is a physical station with beakers, test tubes, graduated cylinders, and other such chemical experimentation tools. It has a cabinet below it. The last station is a communications station akin to the one in the physics lab.</para>
      <para>The biology lab is connected to the general lab and the physics lab. There are four sta-tions in this lab. The first station has four microscopes, of varying sizes, but with the same capabilities. The second station is theoretical, and is like the other theoretical sta-tions, but geared towards biological experiments. The third station is a catch-all station. It can be used to prepare specimens, analyze living flora and fauna, do preliminary ex-aminations of dead tissue, and whatever other uses the science staff can invent in the realm of biology. The fourth station is a communications station.</para>
      <para>The general purpose lab, in its default configuration, has four stations. There are three theoretical stations which are copies of the theoretical stations in each of the specific labs, and one communications station, which is a permanent fixture. Although the mis-sion of the Brian Olinski is primarily for combat and space superiority, due to the ex-tended nature of some of the ship's missions, this lab can be modified to become a  basic laboratory for robotics, stellar cartography, archeology, or astrosociobiology (also referred to as extraterrestrial anthropology). For robotics, only two stations are present - a theoretical station, and a large practical station which allows for the manipulation of robotic devices and components via gravitational and force fields. For stellar cartog-raphy, there are four panels arrayed around a centralized three-dimensional projection field that can show the area around the vessel in a spherical display (up to the maxi-mum range of the sensors), and provide more detail of selected areas, if possible. As an archeology lab, it is similar to the biology lab, but the third station is an input area for a general cultural database. As an astrosociobiology lab, there are three work stations akin to those in the Intelligence offices, but they access more specified cultural data-bases for crew use.</para>
      <para>This lab has a walled-off area for the CSO, which serves as an office, and has a desk and three chairs, as well as four wall displays detailing the operations occurring in each of the laboratories.</para>

      <title>Marine Headquarters</title>
      <para>Located on deck 32, the Marine Headquarters provides offices for the Marine outfit aboard the Brian Olinski. It is smaller than the other offices, with only room for the Ma-rine Commander's office and four desks. The Marine Commander's office has  The desks are all for one person, and include a chair, two drawers on either side, and an enlarged mobile PADD-style screen. This headquarters serves as a central area for both Marine pilots and ground personnel, and can be reconfigured to brief individual sections or squads.</para>

      <title>Pilot's Briefing Room</title>
      <para>Located directly above the hangar on deck 36, it has sixty seats in stadium style, a vid-eo display, and a podium. It allows the CAG to brief pilots on their flight orders for the day. The room can send information to all PADD devices, and the podium allows the CAG to manipulate what appears on the screen. The seats themselves are padded, with two arm rests a piece, and ergonomic backing.</para>

      <title>CAG's Office</title>
      <para>Directly connected to the briefing room and the hallway which leads to it, the CAG's Office consists of a desk, three chairs, and a display of both the pilots' roster and the status of any fighter on board. As the CAG is generally a pilot, the latter is defaulted to the CAG's personal fighter.</para>

      <title>Flight Simulators</title>
      <para>Located on deck 35, this area is a set of six linked single-level holodecks. They are re-stricted to pilot use only, and only a pilot can activate one, which is capable of simulating situations for one or two fighters. The holodeck, however, only provides full-scale imitations of the cockpit and shell of any of the four fighter types stationed aboard the Brian Olinski class. Only a squadron leader or the CAG can activate more than one of them and link the simulations. Unlike a typical holodeck simulation, the exterior view from each fighter is only a projection one meter away from the shell of the holographic cockpit. It allows the pilot to react to the situation presented, and to feel what would happen due to their reaction, from g-forces to impacts. However, if one were to walk in to one of these holodecks during a simulation, one would only see cockpit-size black blobs suspended in midair. These simulators come pre-loaded with 300 different situations, all of which have settings for individual and squad-based combat. They have emergency power shutoffs accessible from outside of each room, as well as on paneling above, on deck 34.</para>

      <title>Combat Information Center</title>
      <para>Located at the aft of deck 37, and looking out on the Fighter Hangar, the Combat Infor-mation Center oversees all auxiliary spacecraft which launch from and land aboard the Brian Olinski. The area consists of a view port which looks out on the fighter hangar, five chairs, three large panels, and two displays, both of which are status boards. The port side display shows fighters and other craft under maintenance or simply idle, while the starboard display shows fighters and other craft that have launched, or are waiting to launch or land. The panels below the displays allow the officers in the Combat Infor-mation Center to access information on any given craft, while the panel in front of the view port allows information relay to auxiliary craft, as well as to the Flight Operations station on the Bridge. There is a rectangular table in the center of the room with about one-third of the square footage of the room that serves as a tactical display for the CIC. It displays the immediate area around the vessel in a top-down grid fashion, with the placement of all vessels. Its ratio is defaulted at 1/60000, but can be zoomed in or out depending on what the staff in the CIC needs to see. The table also has a holo-projector which can provide a 3-dimensional perspective of the battle, incorporating the z-axis. Due to this tactical display being of secondary importance for sensor use during combat compared to information which the helm and tactical stations on the bridge require, there is a two-second lag between real-time and what the table shows. The CAG issues orders to all fighter, shuttle, and runabout pilots from this area.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Shuttle Bays</title>
      <para>The two forward openings on the hull, covered by sliding plates, are the main shuttle bays. They are three decks tall, from decks 31 to 33, and each bay is 110 meters wide and 40 meters long. The crew can access them from doors leading to deck 33. Each has a force shield which keeps in atmosphere even while auxiliary craft arrive. Generally, the Brian Olinski holds four Liberty-class runabouts in each bay, for eight total, as the Marines tend to need something heavier than regular shuttles or shuttle pods in their landing missions, and regular landing parties benefit from a larger vessel as well. However, the bays can also hold twelve Armadillo shuttles a piece - twenty-four total - or be converted in to extra fighter hangars</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Fighter Hangar</title>
      <para>The Fighter Hangar comprises the entirety of decks 37 to 39, with the exception of Combat Information Center. At 300 meters wide and 450 meters long, it is a gigantic space, and therefore has additional structural integrity and inertia dampening field generators. The opening at the front of the hangar is 100 meters wide. Regular storage is on the starboard side of the hangar, while the port side is for maintenance. The central area is for landing and for fighters ready to launch. Typically, the ship carries twelve Ranger-class bombers, twelve Templar-class heavy fighters, and a further forty-eight Cutlass or Compsognathus-class fighters, making six squadrons of twelve total. On average, twelve to eighteen fighters are in maintenance, with a dedicated mechanical crew on staff, one to two squadrons are on alert, and the rest are sitting in their regular storage bays. At least one squadron is reserved for Marine use.</para>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <para>The Brian Olinski was designed to be a powerful vessel of war, capable of surviving heavy engagements and coming out the other side looking even more fearsome for it. Should the need arise, the Brian Olinski class will become the weapon of a new war, and although the Federation wishes to keep its image as a government of peace, few will doubt that it is capable of fighting back with fury.</para>
