History and Mission Overview
============================

> "I swear by Apollo the physician, by Aesculapius, Hygeia, and Panacea,
> and take to witness all the gods, all the goddesses, to keep according
> to my ability and my judgment the following oath:"

Necessity is the mother of invention. That ancient mantra was proven yet
again during the Dominion War when countless Federation citizens
suffered without proper medical care. What was most shocking, however,
was the revelation that Starfleet was not fully equipped to deal with
the massive number of wounded that a drawn out full-scale war created.
While there were ships dedicated to medical operations, there was a lack
of a complete field hospital unit. The McCoy was intended to fill that
gap. While designed as a battlefield support craft, it is also capable
of civilian mercy operations.

The McCoy-class Medical Cruiser was designed by a team of Starfleet and
civilian engineers working at the Arbuckle Ship Yards at Zeta Maxtor.
The command team consisted of:

Project Leader Fleet Captain T'Nira, Starfleet Command
Engineering Specialist Sesenta Nyan, Starfleet R&D
Computer Systems Engineer Lt. Cmdr. Linnis, Nyetscape Communications
Liason
Medical Facility Overseer Dr. Lillith Beaumont, Starfleet Medical,
retired
Spin Doctor Groucho Marx, Starfleet Office of Public Relations
Manual and Documentation by Lt. (j.g.) Tavorak Rhiannen, Starfleet
Medical
The primary goal of the McCoy was to provide a mobile medical facility
for onsite treatment and for transport. As such, it includes three
methods of loading wounded onto the ship. First is the trusty standby;
the transporter. The McCoy's transporters are standard Starfleet
personnel transporters. Second is a pair of Medically Equipped
Valhalla-class runabouts. These support craft serve to ferry wounded
between the field and the vessel, and to extend potential treatment
range. The third is the ability of the McCoy to land, thus bringing the
hospital directly to ground-based wounded. Combined, these three methods
should allow the McCoy to successfully reach almost any potentially
wounded personnel.

Structure and Construction
==========================

> "To consider dear to me as my parents him who taught me this art;"

Engineers looked back at both the Defiant-class and Miranda-class ships
in designing this specialized vessel. Like the Defiant, the McCoy's
bridge is dropped into Deck One, making it easier to shield. The McCoy
uses a Starfleet Mode II spaceframe, like the Miranda and Soyuz-classes
and is a total of 10 decks high.

The McCoy also utilizes variable-geometry warp nacelles. In sub-orbital
flight, the nacelles are raised 90 degrees to be coplanar with the main
body of the ship, allowing for the emergence of six specialized landing
struts. The landing struts, three pairs fore, aft, and midship, extend
beyond the hull. The McCoy is able to land and take-off from bodies up
to 1.3g. Special atmospheric thrusters are distributed around the ship
to allow for adequate sub-orbital flight.

The top rear of the vessel includes a weapons/sensor array, where the
photon torpedo launchers are situated.

The hull is comprised of standard starship-grade tritanium. Deck One is
given extra protection in the form of a thin layer of ablative armor
covering the bridge and primary sickbay.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems
==================================

> "To live in common with him and if necessary to share my goods with
> him,"

Sensors
-------

The McCoy is equipped with standard navigational and sensory systems
common to most starships. Active scan subspace sensory systems provide a
high-resolution range of approximately 5 light-years and medium- to
low-resolution range of approximately 17 light-years. Sensor
capabilities include astronomical observation, planetary surface
analysis, and remote lifeform analysis. The main sensors are in the
weapons/sensor array, located above the aft section of the main body.

Computer Systems
----------------

Computing facilities on board the McCoy are provided by a DC-8 isolinear
computer core, provided by Starfleet partner Federation Micro Devices. A
series of 24 bio-neural gel packs augment the computer systems in the
Primary and Secondary Sickbays to provide faster branch prediction and
analysis for medical operations.

The operating system and software was provided by the venerable
Nyetscape Communications. The interface is the standard Starfleet MAJEL
visual and auditory feedback interface, present on most starships. The
standard interface is situated atop a custom computer system developed
jointly by Nyetscape and Starfleet R&D. It is a non-AI highly
specialized kernel, which uses Starfleet standard interface methods for
an easier learning curve. To most, the computer is transparent and
indistinguishable from standard Starfleet computer systems. The system
is designed specifically with a medical ship in mind, and contains vast
databases of medical knowledge for hundreds of species. The OS
development project was headed by Starfleet officer Lt. Cmdr. Linnis,
formerly of the USS Seraph. Lt. Cmdr. Linnis was forced to leave the
project shortly before completion, however, and the rest of the
development team chose to name the final project in her honor, hence the
name: Linnux.

Holographic Systems
-------------------

The McCoy-class does not carry any holographic crew. However, the
medical research labs are equipped with a holographic display column to
allow for scalable visualization for research and exploratory surgery.
The display can be tied directly into any medical sensors in the
Secondary Sickbay, including the biobeds and ICU ward.

Probes
------

McCoy is equipped with a mixed supply of scientific probes, stored in
the weapons/sensor array over the aft dorsal. They are launched through
the standard torpedo tubes.

Warp Propulsion Systems
=======================

> "to look upon his children as my own brothers, to teach them this art
> if they so desire without fees or written promise;"

The McCoy-class is powered by one 1500+ cochrane warp core powering two
variable-geometry nacelles. In sub-light mode, the nacelles hang down
below Deck Ten at 90 degrees to the plane of the ship. During warp, the
nacelles rise up to between 30 degrees and 60 degrees from their normal
position, depending on the subspace conditions of the region. In
sub-orbital flight, the nacelles are raised 90 degrees to be coplanar
with the main body of the ship, allowing for the emergence of six
specialized landing struts. The landing struts, three pairs fore, aft,
and midship, extend beyond the hull.

The McCoy is rated for a cruising speed of warp 6. It's maximum
sustainable velocity is warp 8.5. It is rated for warp 9.7 for 12 hours
before it begins to experience structural damage.

Impulse Propulsion Systems
==========================

> "To impart to my sons and the sons of the master who taught me and the
> disciples who have enrolled themselves and have agreed to the rules of
> the profession, but to these alone, the precepts and the instruction;"

Two fusion-powered impulse engines supply sub-light propulsion for the
McCoy. They are located on the rear face of the main body, one at
extreme port and the other at extreme starboard. Together they provide
sufficient power to maintain a maximum impulse speed of 0.27c.

Tactical Systems
================

> "I will prescribe regimen for the good of my patients according to my
> ability and my judgment and never to do harm to anyone."

Since its mission is to help, not harm, McCoy strikes a more defensive,
than offensive, pose. It relies more on speed and maneuverability than
on weapons systems or heavy shielding. If necessary, however, it does
sport four Type X phaser arrays, two Type IX phaser arrays, and two
photon torpedo launchers.

Shields
-------

The McCoy-class utilizes a standard deflector shielding system for
defense. The deflectors are rated at a maximum graviton load of 2034
MegaWatts with a maximum dissipation rate of 4.2x10\^4 kilowatts.

The McCoy is also equipped with metaphasic shields for use in high
radiation areas. It should be recalled, however, that metaphasic
shielding does not provide tactical defensive protection.

Phaser Systems
--------------

Type X phaser arrays are spread evenly around the ship. One array
extends around the dorsal port side of the main body, following the
contour of the hull. It is mirrored by a second array on the dorsal
starboard side. A third array extends around the entire ventral side of
the main body, terminating at the same points sternward as the dorsal
arrays. The last array stretches across the rear of the vessel between
the impulse engines to cover the instance when the ship is being
pursued. The outer face of each nacelle is home to a Type IX phaser
array, to serve as cover for side defense. The phaser system provides
360 degree coverage with limited overlap.

Torpedo Systems
---------------

The torpedo launchers are situated in the weapons/sensor array, above
the rear of the main body. They share a single loading and storage bay,
but one is facing fore, the other aft. Together they provide 360 degree
coverage using standard fire-and-forget targeting. The McCoy carries a
standard load of 30 photon torpedoes.

Utility Systems
===============

> "To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug, nor give advice
> which may cause his death."

Cargo Bays
----------

The McCoy-class is equipped with limited cargo facilities on Deck Ten.
These are generally devoted almost entirely to medical supplies. Each
cargo bay is equipped with a single cargo transporter.

Tractor Beam Systems
--------------------

The McCoy is fitted with one primary tractor emitter at extreme ventral
aft. It is capable of hauling small to medium cargo and towing of
medium-sized disabled vessels, but is not as powerful as those on larger
vessels. It is rated at 4,800,000 million metric tonnes for an object
1,000 meters away at a delta-v of 5 m/sec\^2.

Transporter Systems
-------------------

Four transporter rooms allow the McCoy to transport injured personnel
directly to either the Secondary Sickbay or the Triage Deck. Transporter
Rooms One and Two are located on Deck 2, immediately aft of the
Secondary Sickbay. Transporter Rooms Three and Four are located on Deck
Nine, in the aft section of the Triage Deck. Each pair shares a pattern
buffer for space efficiency. All transporter rooms contain eight
transporter pads, and have a nominal range of 40,000 km.

Crew Support Systems
====================

> "But I will preserve the purity of my life and my art."

Sickbays
--------

The McCoy sports multiple sickbay facilities. The Primary Sickbay is
situated on Deck One, just aft of the main bridge. It includes the CMO's
office, four standard biobeds, and one with a dedicated surgical support
frame (SSF).

The larger Secondary Sickbay is on Deck Two. It provides another ten
biobeds, four more with SSFs, and dental facilities. The adjacent
Intensive Care Unit contains four completely quarantined units, capable
of supporting class M or K environments, temperatures ranging from -40
degrees Celsius to 98 degrees Celsius, and providing over a dozen
different possible atmospheres. Three dedicated surgical suites and a
physical therapy facility round out the Secondary Sickbay. Also adjacent
are extensive medical research and analysis labs. All sickbay facilities
use independent environmental systems to eliminate the risk of ship-wide
contamination.

Triage Deck
-----------

Deck Nine is configured as a large, open area, with limited storage
facilities for removable bulkheads. This "Triage Deck" can be
reconfigured using removable and folding bulkheads into a triage center,
guest quarters, surgical center, or additional sickbay, depending on the
requirements of the mission. A full reconfiguration can be performed in
approximately ten minutes. The aft section of the deck has transporter
rooms three and four, so that wounded can be beamed directly into what
can be used as a triage area. Two gangplanks extend through the rear of
Deck Ten to load wounded directly onto the Triage Deck in case of a
landing.

Recreational Deck
-----------------

Recreation for the crew is provided by a pair of holosuites on Deck Six.
For those preferring interaction with live people, a small crew bar and
lounge is situated at the fore of Deck Six. A small workout room is also
present on Deck Six, and both crew and patients are encouraged to take
advantage of the substantial health benefits of a regular workout
regimen.

Alternate Environment Support
-----------------------------

The Intensive Care Unit on Deck Two is capable of class M or K
environments, temperatures ranging from -40 degrees Celsius to 98
degrees Celsius, and providing over a dozen different possible
atmospheres. The Triage Deck can also have its atmosphere varied,
although due to construction limitations the entire deck is altered at
once. Deck Nine is capable of gravity variation between 0.6g and 1.2g.

Medical Modules
---------------

Extra medical modules are carried on Deck 10 of McCoy, including science
modules designed to provide on-site laboratory testing in quarantined
areas and self-sustaining field hospital kits. These pre-fab modular
hospitals can be erected in minutes on planetary surfaces. Each comes
with a self-contained generator and emergency replicator. Battery packs
included with the generator enable the field hospitals to run for up to
one week under normal conditions.

Auxiliary Spacecraft Systems
============================

> "I will not cut for stone, even for patients in whom the disease is
> manifest. I will leave this operation for practitioners (specialists
> in the art);"

Two Valhalla-class runabouts with dedicated medical modules are housed
on Deck Ten. These auxiliary craft can function as an "ambulance in
space" to ferry wounded between the ship and the target site or the ship
and a larger medical facility, or they can also function as small field
hospitals when needed.

In an era of increased military focus in Starfleet, the McCoy-class
seeks to fill a needed gap in the fleet; that of caring for those
injured by combat maneuvers. Since its deployment into the field, the
McCoy has been credited with a substantial decrease in the number of
DOAs registered by Starfleet Medical facilities. Approved for use in
both fleet operations and independent operation, the McCoy brings a
humanitarian feel back to a Starfleet desperately in need.
