    <title>History and Mission Overview</title>
    <para>The Monolith Class Cargo Ship was designed with the purpose of fulfilling Star-Fleet's ever-growing need for a bulk transport ship. With various warring species a constant threat, Star-fleet needed a ship that could get supplies out to places where they were needed, without having to waste time with a cruiser that would best serve elsewhere.</para>
    <para>One of the Monolith's most unique features is the ability to become in essence a warp-capable freight train. Special cargo modules can be attached to the back of the actual ship to allow even more cargo space.</para>
    <para>The Monolith is powered by one primary MARA warp core. 10 primary fusion generators, and 5 back-up generators provide emergency power. They switch on if the primary ones fail. This will provide the ship with half of its normal power so some systems will go offline to compensate. Engine ratings will suffer if the back-up ones are in use. All other non-essential systems will either go off-line or be restrained.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Structure and Construction</title>
    <para>The Monolith freighter was not intended to be pretty, but to be functional.  The Monolith is 13 decks tall and composed of a cylindrical body with a small box attached to the top (See Message on Decks 1-4). The nacelles jut out at angles downward from the main body to give it almost a sled-like look. Decks 1-4 are just as wide as the rest of the ship, but are not as long.  These decks jut out over the other decks as a sort of "lid." These decks are the "Administration'" decks of the ship, so to speak. Decks 5-13 are organized in a different manner as well. The fore half of Decks 5-13 is reserved for the parts of the ship that don't fall into the 'Administration' decks. These include Main Engineering, the Warp Core, etc. The aft half of these decks is reserved for the many cargo bays.  The main deflector dish is located in the lower front section of the main body. The Monolith-class employs standard tritanium alloy in its hull construction.</para>
    <para>The Monolith is constructed at the Arbuckle Ship Yards in the Zeta Maxtor system, Fleet Four.</para>
    <para>The Monolith supports external expansion modules, each of which is also cylindrical.  A single module can be connected to hardpoints on the aft face of the vessel, and additional modules can be connected to the aft of a given module, creating a "freight train" appearance.</para>
    <para>Each module can range from additional cargo space to repair bays for starship components to troop transports.  Internal configuration is alterable by means of sliding and retractable bulkheads inside each module, including retractable deck plating in cargo modules.  Modules contain fusion reactors to power life support systems and minimal thrusters for docking and station-keeping, however, impulse and warp propulsion is provided by the Monolith itself.  A maximum of two modules can be attached to a given ship at a time, due to warp field geometry restrictions.</para>

    <title>Science and Remote Sensing Systems</title>
    <section>
      <title>Computer Systems</title>
      <para>A full starship-grade computer system seemed like a waste to the design team.  Instead, they forewent the traditional LCARS system and opted instead for a freighter-specific computer system developed by Starfleet partner Nyetscape Communications.  The system, <link linkend="bigrig">Basic I/O Grunt - Regimented Information Grouper (BIG RIG)</link>, was built around a conventional isolinear core ODN network, and was optimized for logistical and material management, and suffices as a solid, work-horse system.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Sensory Systems</title>
      <para>The Monolith, not designed to care about spatial phenomenon, has a very basic sensor system. It allows for basic navigational, long range, and short range scanning ability. They are adequate for cargo transportation, but inferior to those present on most starships.  There are no probes included with the Monolith, as Starfleet deemed it too expensive.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Holographic Technology</title>
      <para>The Monolith-class is equipped with a single holodeck on 4 for crew recreation.  No other holo-emitters are present on the ship, nor is the power grid equipped to handle them.  The class does not support an Emergency Medical Hologram.</para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Warp Propulsion Systems</title>
    <para>The Monolith isn't designed with speed in mind. Star-Fleet deemed it too expensive to install powerful the warp engines of a cruiser. As a result, the Monolith's speed ratings are relatively slow.</para>
    <para>The Monolith can reach a maximum warp of Warp Factor 7.2 for 12 hours. Cruising speed for the Monolith is Warp Factor 5, with a maximum sustainable velocity of warp 6.  Maximum warp with 2 tug units attached is Warp Factor 6.1, which can be sustained for 12 hours. Cruising speed with 2 tug units attached is Warp Factor 4, with a maximum sustainable velocity of warp 5.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Impulse Propulsion Systems</title>
    <para>The Monolith has a full impulse speed of 0.24c when the main impulse engines are on and auxiliary power activated. Full impulse when 2 tug units are attached is 0.21c There are two impulse engines on the rear of the main ship, above the docking latch that connects the other modules.</para>
    <para>The Monolith also has standard RCS thrusters for docking and station-keeping.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Tactical Systems</title>
    <para>As it was not intended for combat situations, the Monolith contains only the most basic defenses.  It is highly recommended that, should it be required to enter a combat zone, that it do so under escort.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Defensive Shielding</title>
      <para>The Monolith-class employs a very basic defensive shield grid, as it is not expected to enter combat situations without an escort, if ever.  It has a modest maximum graviton load of 1253 MegaWatts, with a maximum energy dissipation rate of 3.7x10^5 KiloWatts.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Phaser Systems</title>
      <para>The Monolith carries 4 Type-VII Phaser Arrays. Each array has a total of 200 emitters.  All four arrays wrap around the ship width-wise, one dorsal fore (just aft of the Administration Decks), one dorsal aft, one ventral fore, and one ventral aft.  Together they provide almost 360 degree coverage, with some blind spots.  Modules do not contain any weapons systems, and do create an additional weapons blind spot.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Torpedo Systems</title>
      <para>The Monolith carries one photon torpedo launcher, located center-forward in the main body, just above the navigational deflector.  The Monolith carries a payload of 25 standard photon torpedoes.</para>
    </section>

    <title>Utility Systems</title>
    <section>
      <title>Cargo Bays</title>
      <para>The Monolith's cargo bays are the main features of the ship. 15 cargo bays provide ample storage for most anything. If more space is needed, cargo modules may be used. There are also three cargo transporters on each deck below Deck 5. These provide ample transport for goods.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Tractor Beam Systems</title>
      <para>The Monolith is equipped with a single main tractor beam emitter on the ship's aft ventral point. It uses 2 graviton polarity sources for a total of 32 MegaWatt graviton displacement.  At a nominal delta-v of 5 m/sec^2, the main tractor beam emitters are capable of handing a mass of 7,500,000 metric tonnes at less than 1,000 meters.  For a mass of one metric tonne at the same delta-v, the effective range is 20,000  kilometers.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Transporter Systems</title>
      <para>Two transporter rooms, each with 5 transport pads, are located on deck 3.  They have a nominal range of 30,000 kilometers.</para>
