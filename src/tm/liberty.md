History and Mission Overview
============================

After several years of service, Star Fleet decided that a new runabout
was needed to compliment the existing Danube-class. Step forward Avalon
Ship Yards, a busy group of designers who had proved themselves a
valuable tool for Starfleet with their previous designs.

The designers at Avalon realised that they didn't need to make new
Danube-class, and so they set about coming up with a design that would
be just as reliable and enduring, but suitably different. After several
weeks of nose-to-the-grindstone work they presented Star Fleet with
three possible designs. Star Fleet chose the third of these, dubbed
"Liberty" by the designer. This became the prototype for the
Liberty-class runabout.

As a Runabout, the Liberty-class falls between the roles of shuttlecraft
and Star Ship. The Liberty-class is expected to perform such tasks as

Rapid response rescue missions
Short-term scientific missions
Transport of cargo and personnel
Emergency tactical missions
Structure and Construction
==========================

> "We spared no expense"

> — John Hammond

The designers at Avalon "borrowed" from recent Star Fleet designs when
designing the hull of the Liberty-class. The main hull looks like a
scaled down version of the saucer section of the Nova-class, included
the "cut-away" section at the front, which on the Liberty-class houses
the deflector array.

The warp nacelles inherited the engine cowling of the Defiant-class warp
propulsion system. They are located on the dorsal surface of the hull,
with the cowling covering them on the dorsal surface. The ventral
surface is smooth, aside from the landing gear.

The interior of the craft is built around a central corridor, which
connects to the key areas of the ship.

Access hatches are mounted to the front (Port and starboard of the
deflector array) dorsal, and aft. Four landing gear, located at 45, 135,
225 and 315 degrees, allow the Liberty-class to land on any surface that
will support the weight of the craft.

The Liberty-class is constructed from tritanium and duranium alloys,
with transparent aluminium use for the view ports. Avalon used
Transporter Welding when making Liberty-class vessels, although some
Ship Yards do not.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems
==================================

Sensor systems
--------------

The Liberty-class Runabout has sensor units located throughout the main
hull, with a good number in a forward mount behind the deflector array.
High-resolution scanning range is 0.8 light-years; low resolution is 3.6
light years.

Computer Systems
----------------

The Liberty-class has two computer cores. Both are comprised of 8
processing units utilising isolinear chips with a single bio-neural gel
pack attached to each core for enhanced processing speed.

Scientific probes
-----------------

The Liberty-class carries 10 micro-probes as standard, and can carry
more if necessary at the expense of its micro-torpedo payload.

Warp Propulsion Systems
=======================

> "Why do rats desert a sinking ship?"
>
> — Agent K

The Liberty-class Runabout is fitted with a warp core rated at 300
Cochranes. This allows a Cruising Velocity of Warp 3, a Maximum
Sustainable Velocity of Warp 4, and a Maximum Velocity of Warp 4.5

Impulse Propulsion Systems
==========================

> "It used to come with a Black dude but he kept getting pulled over."
>
> — Agent J

Two sub-scaled impulse units provide sub-light propulsion and primary
power generation for the Liberty-class. It can reach a speed of 0.24c,
which it can accelerate to from 0 in 12 seconds. Slowing from full
impulse to 0 takes 20 seconds.

Tactical Systems
================

> "You underestimate me, Galvatron."
>
> — Unicron

Defensive Shields
-----------------

The Maximum Gravitational Load of the Liberty-class Runabout's shielding
is 150 MW. The shield has a Maximum Energy Dissipation Rate of 2.23 X
10\^3.

Metaphasic Shields
------------------

The Liberty-class is fitted with a metaphasic shield to protect it from
natural phenomena while on scientific missions.

Phaser Systems
--------------

The Liberty-class is fitted with 6 type-V beam phaser strips, each
consisting of 5 emitters. These are located forward-dorsal,
forward-ventral, aft-dorsal, aft-ventral, port and starboard, to provide
maximum protection. Energy output of these phasers is 0.2 MW

Torpedo Systems
---------------

There are two micro-torpedo launchers on the Liberty-class; one mounted
forward, one mounted aft. Both have 15 micro-torpedoes. The forward
launcher also launches micro-probes.

Command and Support Systems
===========================

> "But Prime, I'm just a soldier."
>
> — Ultra Magnus

The "Bridge" of the Liberty-class is located at the front of the craft.
Conn and Ops are at the front, with science to port and engineering to
starboard. Any of these can double as Tactical in combat. Although
intended for 4 people to crew the craft, it is possible for as few as 1
to fly the Liberty-class if needed.

There is a small, general use science lab found in the port compartment
behind the Bridge.

Utility Systems
===============

> "So we're not even sure they work?"
>
> — Rollbar

Tractor Beam Systems
--------------------

The Tractor beam has a range of 7,500km, dependent on the speed and mass
of the object being tractored.

Transporter Systems
-------------------

A transporter pad is located to the aft, which can transport 4 people up
to 10,000km.

Crew Support Systems
====================

> "Want some coffee?"
>
> — Anonymous Worm Guy

A small "Sickbay" area is located starboard, opposite the science lab.
This is composed of a single bio-bed and basic medical supplies, plus
Med-kits for field use.

A "bunk room" contains 3 wall-mounted beds for the crew to use. An
additional 3 beds can be added, but space will be cramped.

There is also a dining table and replicator. This area can also double
as a briefing area.

Conclusion
==========

> "You cannot imagine"

> — Scythe-Meister

The Liberty-class is a general purpose Runabout, designed to serve as a
compliment to the larger ships of Starfleet. While it lacks the modular
design of the highly successful Danube, it compensates with lower
maintenance requirements associated with only having to deal with a
single craft.
