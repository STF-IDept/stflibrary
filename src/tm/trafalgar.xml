    <title>History and Mission Overview</title>
    <para>Following the First Borg Incursion of late 2366 and the subsequent demolition of a large percentage of Starfleet's defense wing in early 2367, it became clear to Starfleet Command that Klingons, Romulans, Cardassians, and other near-space forces were not the only Threats to the survival of the Federation. Dreadnoughts and Heavy Cruisers were to remain the backbone of Starfleet defense, but Command felt a need for a smaller, more maneuverable, and less costly ship. The design would need to be easy to construct, easy to maintain, and cheap to lose, yet powerful enough to not be lost very often.</para>
    <para>With the decision to mothball the older Chernobyl-class, intended to fill the same role but a total failure in the field, the project became that much more important.  Following the Klingon Civil War one year later, Starfleet pushed the project into Priority One status, and by mid-2368 the specifications were ready.  Those specifications were approved in late 2368 and construction on the new hulls began early the next year. At about the same time as the loss of the Enterprise-D in late 2371, the U.S.S. Trafalgar (NX-84708) underwent preliminary testing and was finally proclaimed space-worthy two days after the Klingon invasion of Cardassia in early 2372.</para>

      <para>The 13-deck Chernobyl-class was intended to supplement larger craft in military maneuvers, as well as engage in tactical scouting and patrol missions.</para>
      <para>For unknown reasons, however, the entire line seems to have been cursed.  All constructed Chernobyl-class vessels were lost or destroyed with all hands within three years of leaving spacedock.  Finally, after the USS Pokhran exploded as it was leaving the assembly lines at the Churlsan Han Fleet Yards, Starfleet Command terminated the series.</para>

      <title>Mission Profile</title>
      <para>The Trafalgar's official job description is as follows: "Patrol of Hostile Borders; Escort for top-security shipments; Assistance in Military Maneuvers."</para>
      <para>In major military fleet operations, the Trafalgar is often used as a complement to more powerful ships such as the Battlecruisers, Dreadnoughts, and Heavy Cruisers. While these larger vessels direct massive amounts of firepower at the enemy, the Trafalgar uses its maneuverability to annoy the Threat and attempt to disable it, as well as provide an additional distraction while the larger vessels head in for the kill.</para>
      <para>In independent operation, the Trafalgar is equipped for medium military duty, combat against inferior Threat powers to free larger vessels for combat against more powerful adversaries, border patrol in high activity regions, and escort duty.  It is designed to pack as much firepower into a small, easy to build and cheap to lose package as possible.</para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Structure and Construction</title>
    <para>The Trafalgar-class employs a sharply angled "neck-less" design, similar to a squared off Intrepid-class, only with a circular rather than elliptical saucer.  Original research determined the optimal number of decks required was 13, but following the disaster of the Chernobyl-class, it was decided to increase the ship's habitable volume to 14 decks and include additional support equipment.  Deck Seven runs the entire length of the ship, while all other decks are limited to one half of the ship or the other.</para>
    <para>The Trafalgar is powered by two warp nacelles on static, straight pylons, and are located level with the top of the saucer section, to provide the smallest possible profile.  The angled body, while not necessarily the most warp-efficient, also decreases the overall profile of the ship.</para>
    <para>The hull is composed of a dense duranium/tritanium truss, with a tritanium composite hull reinforced by a high powered Structural Integrity Field (SIF).  The designers opted to forego ablative armor in favor of more durable material in the hull itself, which provided nearly the same hull strength and resistance to Threat firepower while keeping the vessel's mass low, to allow for higher speeds and a better turning radius.</para>
    <para>For added structural support, much of the ship ties directly into the main spaceframe.  The spaceframe extends far deeper into the ship than in most designs, allowing the entire ship to take the force of an attack rather than just one segment of it.  The net result is an overall increase in hull durability and endurance of 17% over traditional spaceframes.  One unfortunate side effect, however, is that some parts of the ship are therefore not easily replaceable.  In one notable example, the Chief Engineer's chair in his office on Deck 10 is phaser-welded directly into the spaceframe.  In order to save costs during the construction of the USS Montgomery, NCC-84704, the salvaged CE's chair from the destroyed USS Chernobyl was used for the new CE's chair, and gamma-welded into the spaceframe.  The Chernobyl class's curse extended to the Montgomery, which has suffered severe structural damage as a matter of course ever since.</para>
    <para>The exception to the complete integration design is the main bridge, which, as on most starships, is a dry-dock-swappable module to allow for easier upgrading.  This design has proven invaluable in replacing damaged or destroyed bridges on the aforementioned USS Montgomery.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Mission Modules</title>
      <para>Although the Trafalgar's main purpose is military operations, the designers felt that they could not account for every contingency in a single design, nor did they have the room to do so.  As the ship was not expected to be out of contact with Starfleet that frequently, it was decided that a basic mission module system was the best way to increase the flexibility of the design without increasing its size.  Each module is intended to supplement the vessel's existing systems with specialized equipment for a given type of mission.  Although the extra seams where the module and ship meet are not as strong as the rest of the ship, the module is recessed a half-meter into its enclosure and the edges are then covered by retractable locking mechanisms.  The net loss in physical integrity under extreme stress was found to be less than 5%, and in a location unlikely to receive regular fire, and was therefore deemed acceptable.</para>
      <para>A bay for swappable mission modules is located at the fore end of Deck Eight, just above the main deflector.  It extends roughly 3/5 of the length of the deck.  It is not large enough to include a notable amount of habitable space, but does allow for dedicated equipment modules that can be exchanged at your friendly neighborhood starbase to suit a particular mission.  Currently produced modules include:</para>

          <listitem><para>Additional sensor equipment, specifically calibrated for tracking of Threat vessels at great distances.  Although not useful for scientific study or mapping, it does extend the effective range of long-range sensors by nearly 30%.  Short-range targeting resolution is also increased by 15%.  Later models include an integrated <link linkend="ets">Emissions Tracking System</link>, which allows for very limited tracking of improperly calibrated cloaking systems.  It does not provide sufficient resolution to acquire a weapons lock.</para></listitem>

          <term>Heavy Combat Module</term>
          <listitem><para>The HCM includes an additional torpedo launcher in the center, mounted horizontally so that the reactant injectors are placed on either side of it.  The compact design allows room for two forward-facing Type-VIII pulse phaser cannons to be placed on either side of the torpedo launcher.  An included fusion reactor provides power for the phaser banks while storage space at the aft of the module provides storage for up to 25 photon or quantum torpedoes.  These are standard torpedoes with full 360-degree tracking and targeting systems.</para></listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>Minesweeper Module</term>
          <listitem><para>The MM contains storage and control circuitry for twenty Class A mines.  Each mine utilizes a photon torpedo casing equipped with maneuvering thrusters and a phased fusion reactor powering four rotating retractable turrets.  Turrets are located two dorsal, two ventral, fore and aft, and each has a single Type-V pulse phaser emitter.  When the launch command is given, the computer-controlled sequence launches mines in pairs, which then activate an onboard computer to maneuver the mine to its designated location.  Once all mines are deployed, the arm code is sent via a cross-encrypted 1024 qubit signal, unique to each vessel, and the turrets extend.  A disarm code and a recall code, also uniquely encrypted for each vessel, can be used to take down the field.  An Ident Friend or Foe (IFF) system monitors transponder codes sent by any ship within range.  If the code does not match a valid Federation transponder code, it is considered a target.  The transponder code list can be edited only prior to launch.  Each mine is programmed so that should a target come within 500 meters the maneuvering thrusters will propel the mine towards the target and the fusion core will overload and detonate.</para></listitem>

    <section>
      <title>Sensor Systems</title>
      <para>The Trafalgar-class sensor system is optimized for tactical analysis.  Although it is capable of scientific study if necessary, stellar cartography is not its forte. High-resolution range is approximately six light-years, with medium-to-low resolution tapering off after 20 light-years.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Probes</title>
      <para>A set of ten tactical warp and impulse probes are stored on Deck Eight along with the torpedo systems.  All are designed to utilize standard torpedo casings for more efficent storage.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Computer Systems</title>
      <para>The design team felt that conventional LCARS systems were not adequate for an advanced tactical warship.  Rather than rewrite a computer system from scratch or attempt to adapt the LCARS kernel, they decided to form a partnership with an outside contractor.  The Novsibirsk-based Nyetscape Communications proved eager to take the contract, and made the best bid.  Starfleet and Nyetscape signed a long-term contract for the development of extensible starship-grade computer systems, and Nyetscape would provide the development of numerous systems for Starfleet use over the next several years.</para>
      <para>The joint Starfleet-Nyetscape design team decided to develop a modular system, so as to reduce long-term development costs.  They also decided to utilize an Artificial Intelligence system, based on research conducted by Nyetscape during the late 2350s and early 2360s, and incorporating information learned from a prototype project on the USS Aurora, codenamed "Professor."  The core of the system was built around Nyetscape's Performance Action Validator-Learned Operational Validator AI kernel (PAVLOV), which allowed the system to learn from past experience.  Universal Translation was provided by the Vessel-based Unified Natural Translator (WUNT) system, which Nyetscape had used in certain advanced commercial applications to great success.  Rather than use the Starfleet-standard Multiple Access Jargonistic Enhanced Lexicon interface system (MAJEL) for user input, the design team decided to develop a new interface module from the ground up, optimized for an Artificial Intelligence system. The Russian Oral Modular Altruistic Neo-Organic Voice UI module (ROMANOV) was developed specifically to support PAVLOV-based AI systems, and used a decidedly colloquial front-end.  Specifically, it sounds like a Russian Commissar, and acts like one as well.  The system was later upgraded to support Nyetscape's firewall system, the Limited Entry Network Interface Node system (LENIN).  The final product was dubbed the General Operations Russian-Based Interface, and the system's avatar became known as "GORBI."</para>
      <para>Unfortunately, due to cost constraints Starfleet insisted on using a Federation Micro Devices DC-8 isolinear data array core, rather than the DC-10 as originally intended.  The DC-8 was not powerful enough to handle the added processing required by the GORBI system in software.  As a result, the PAVLOV kernel was burned directly to read-only isolinear hardware and built into the core's chipset at a base level.  The resulting increase in efficiency made the system both powerful and far more stable, but had the side effect of rendering the computer inoperable without the GORBI system active.  As GORBI's MTBF is measured in centuries and has not to date required a full reboot, this is not much of a problem.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Warp Propulsion Systems</title>
    <para>FTL propulsion on the Trafalgar-class is provided by means of a single 1500+ cochrane deuterium/anti-deuterium-powered warp core, designed by Warp Cores 'R' Us, a long time Starfleet contractor.  Two Zoomer Z-7000 fixed-position nacelles provide subspatial distortion for movement.  Zoomer Enterprises, LLC, a small startup firm based in Santa Clara, CA, included a 10 year / 10,000 light-year warranty with each pair of nacelles.</para>
    <para>Due to the Trafalgar's integrated design, the engines can maintain a maximum velocity of warp 9.8 for 12 hours without structural failure.  It can sustain a velocity of 8.6 indefinitely, although standards cruising velocity is warp factor 6.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Impulse Propulsion Systems</title>
    <para>Andor-based Wegoforu Enterprises, Inc. designed and built the impulse engine system.  Four KT-133 fusion superimpellor impulse engines provide sublight propulsion.  Two are located at the aft end of Deck Six, at the back of the saucer, slightly outward from the nacelles.  One is located on each nacelle pylon, low, towards the lower end of the pylon towards the body.  This four-part positioning provides enough power to accelerate the Trafalgar to 0.30c, and allows for unequal-power-distribution-based steering, as well as thruster-assisted maneuvering.  The wide spacing of the engines makes the Trafalgar extremely maneuverable at sublight speeds.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Tactical Systems</title>
    <para>The idea behind the Trafalgar-class was to pack as much firepower into as small a space as possible, and make it deliverable to any location within the Federation as fast as possible.  The Trafalgar's weapons systems reflect this military bent.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Defensive Shielding Systems</title>
      <para>Graviton-based deflector shields provide the first level of defense for the Trafalgar.  Shield grids are located at key locations around the exterior of the ship, and provide a combined maximum continuous graviton load of 1865 megawatts with a maximum energy dissipation rate of 3.7x10^4 kilowatts.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Phaser Systems</title>
      <para>The Trafalgar is fitted with six Type-IX phaser banks and eight Type-VIII phaser banks, arrayed around the ship in order to provide maximum coverage and overlap.</para>
      <para>Four Type-IX strips are located on the dorsal surface of the saucer section, each covering one-quarter of the circumference of the saucer, starting from zero degrees.  They are mirrored by four Type-VIII arrays on the ventral side of the saucer, offset 45 degrees so as to break at a different point than the dorsal phaser banks.  Each of these arrays contains 50 emitters in parallel lock.</para>
      <para>Two 100-emitter Type-IX phaser arrays stretch along the ventral surface of the stardrive section, one port one aft.  They are augmented by a pair of 25-emitter Type-VIII arrays running vertically over the exterior face of the nacelle pylons.  Two 50-emitter Type-VIII strips on the dorsal surface of the nacelles themselves complete the targeting sphere.</para>
      <para>Each phaser strip is designed to function in parallel lock only, so it can fire only a single beam at a time.  This design results in a 14% increase in efficiency and a reduction in reaction time, as well as a 7% increase in power.  Each array is also independently controlled, so all of the banks can be hooked into the central firing computer if desired, or they can be operated independently of each other.  A fire control room on Deck Four provides space for multiple personnel to independently control and operate each phaser bank set either manually or via computer.  Control can also be handled completely via the main tactical console on the bridge.  When centrally operated, multiple banks can be set to fire at the same target point, providing similar resulting damage to a single bank with the same total number of emitters.</para>
      <para>One battery of five Type-VIII pulse phaser cannons is located at the front of the ship on Deck Four.  The battery is affixed to a moveable armored plate, allowing approximately 10 degrees of movement in a given direction; enough for fine aiming provided the target is in front of the vessel.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Torpedo Systems</title>
      <para>Deck Eight houses two forward facing universal torpedo tubes.  They are located at the outer sides of the deck, with space for the Swappable Mission Module allocated between them.  A third torpedo tube is located aft, just above the main shuttlebay, also on Deck Eight.  All tubes use a compact, horizontally mounted design for better space efficiency.  Torpedo storage is provided on Decks Eight and Nine to feed both the fore and aft launchers via automated loading systems.  Each tube is capable of firing photon or quantum torpedoes as well as standard probes, and can be loaded with up to four torpedoes at once for sequential volley fire.  The Trafalgar carries a standard compliment of 125 standard photon torpedoes.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Turret Systems</title>
      <para>Additionally, the Trafalgar carries a number of dumb-fire torpedoes in retractable rotating turrets.  Smaller than standard torpedoes, these projectiles do not contain full guidance or warp sustaining equipment.  They carry only a matter/antimatter payload roughly half that of standard torpedoes and just enough circuitry to maintain level flight at high velocity.  These systems are intended primarily for defensive and close-in/strafing fighting.  They can also be used as anti-missile defense systems against slower projectiles and anti-fighter defense. Two turrets are located on the dorsal saucer, one port one starboard, and a third is located ventral fore of the stardrive section.  Each turret is normally retracted into the hull until needed, at which point it extends approximately 3 meters to arm.  Each turret holds a complement of 25 torpedoes.</para>
      <para>Each turret also sports three Type-VI pulse phaser cannons.  These canons can be used against any target, but are intended primarily for defensive use or when completing a strafing run against a larger target.</para>
      <para>The turret pulse canons can also be used for minesweeping.  A mine, being a stationary target without shielding, would not require more than a single pulse phaser blast to destroy.  The three turrets provide full coverage provided targeting systems can be allocated to the task (vis., the ship is not busy firing at something else).</para>

    <section>
      <title>Main Bridge</title>
      <para>The main bridge module of the Trafalgar-class is based on the same design principle as the Intrepid-class.  The Commanding Officer's chair is in the center of the bridge, and designed to swivel 360 degrees.  The plush velvet covering, available in 4 custom colors, has been declared by most captains to be the best designed command seat in the history of Starfleet.  A single Conn officer sits at a wide station in front of the command seat, facing the large viewscreen.  At the port and starboard sides of the bridge just forward of the command seat are the forward-facing Science/Operations console and Auxiliary Engineering station, respectively.  In the aft of the bridge directly aft of the front consoles are the Internal Security and Tactical consoles, port and starboard respectively.  Between them is the forward facing Executive Officer's station, which serves as both desk and support console for any other station.  Two turbolifts, one on either side of the bridge, give access to the rest of the ship.  A nine-person conference room fitted for mission briefings and situational analysis sits aft the bridge, and is accessible via the port turbolift waiting area or the Captain's Ready Room.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Captain's Ready Room</title>
      <para>Just port of the main bridge is the Captain's Ready Room.  The Ready Room opens into the turbolift waiting area.  Additionally, a trap door behind the desk allows access to the Captain's quarters on Deck 2 in case of emergency or sudden Red Alert.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Deck Two</title>
      <para>Deck Two houses the Commanding Officer's quarters aft port, directly below the Ready Room on Deck One.  The Executive Officer's quarters mirror it on the starboard side, allowing space for the Captain's Yacht between them.  Three VIP quarters for visiting dignitaries are fore.  Deck Two also houses a smaller conference area equipped for more diplomatic and political functions as well as two docking hardpoints with airlocks for when the vessel is docked at a Starbase.</para>

      <title>Cargo Bays</title>
      <para>Four cargo bays on Deck 13 and three on Deck 11 provide ample storage space for most necessities.  The cargo bays on Deck 13 are equipped with cargo transporters, while the ones on Deck 11 have forcefield protected cargo doors that open out into space.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Tractor Beam Systems</title>
      <para>The Trafalgar-class includes a tow tractor beam at the aft ventral end of the stardrive section.  It has a total graviton displacement of 26 megawatts.  The main shuttlebay is also equipped with a tractor beam for guiding incoming shuttlecraft.</para>

      <title>Transporter Systems</title>
      <para>Crew transporters are located on Decks Three and Nine.  Each deck contains two transporter rooms, each of which contains six personnel transporter pads.

      <title>Six Forward</title>
      <para>Although the design team originally intended to keep recreational facilities sparse in order to save costs, the Committee of Officers to Maintain Manageable Interactive Entertainment declared that if the ship did not contain adequate recreational and off-duty facilities they would boycott the entire class.  In order to comply with COMMIE's demands, the design team built a two-level crew lounge into the front of the vessel.  The main area on Deck Six is located fully fore, and includes a full bar with replicators along one wall and seating for 15, as well as a small stage area for presentations and performances.  A smaller balcony area with seating accommodations for 8 overlooks the main floor from Deck Five.  The balcony is accessible via a doorway on Deck Five or via a spiral staircase from the floor below.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Ten Backward</title>
      <para>Ten Backward was originally a typo in the design specification.  At one point, the designers used shorthand to indicate the portion of the ship they were describing in writing.  Common shorthand for "Ten Forward" on most ships is "10->".  Engineer Mike Engels, however, after a long night on the project, accidentally wrote "&lt;-10", which the rest of the design team took to be a request for a "Ten Backward" lounge.  By the time the confusion has been sorted out, the design was already finalized and there was nothing to be done.</para>
      <para>Ten Backward is located aft of Main Engineering on Deck Ten, and is reserved as the Engineers Lounge.  It is accessible via Main Engineering.  Its exact layout is unknown, as non-engineers have rarely been able to enter it to find out, but early blueprints suggest that it has seating for 7, a small bar, and one replicator built into the wall.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Crew Quarters</title>
      <para>As space is at a premium on the Trafalgar-class, standard crew quarters are one room compartments measuring 4 meters by 5 meters in size.  Starfleet Personnel wanted to design each set of quarters to support two crewmen, but COMMIE wouldn't hear of it.  Each compartment is designed for a single occupant.  Three larger compartments are set aside for married couples serving on the same ship.  Senior Officer's quarters are a bit larger, consisting of a 3 meter by 4 meter living area and a 3 meter by 3.5 meter bedroom.  The Commanding Officer's quarters, Executive Officer's quarters, and VIP quarters are laid out the same, but slightly larger.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Holographic Systems</title>
      <para>Although power requirements would generally render holodecks and holsuites inappropriate on a warship, the Committee of Officers to Maintain Manageable Interactive Entertainment insisted.  With pressure from COMMIE breathing down their necks, the design team built a single holodeck into Deck Five, just aft of the Six Forward upper balcony.  A smaller holosuite is also present on Deck Five.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Medical Systems</title>
      <para>The main sickbay is located on Deck Three.  Six standard biobeds and two more with dedicated surgical support frames (SSF) serve the crew.  The CMO's office is located adjacent to the Sickbay, which takes up the bulk of the central area of the deck.  A small medical research lab is attached to sickbay.</para>

      <title>Alternative Environmental Support</title>
      <para>The main shuttlebay can be pressurized with alternate atmospheres to support Oxygen-Nitrogen, Oxygen-Argon, Methane, Hydrochloric, or Fluoride atmospheres.  Other atmospheres are possible with proper configuration.  The Command and VIP quarters on Deck Two can be configured with gravity systems between 0.8g and 1.2g by the Engineering staff at the request of the occupant.</para>

    <title>Conclusion</title>
    <para>The Trafalgar-class was designed to fill in the gaps in Starfleet's military wing in the areas of support, patrol, and search-and-destroy missions.  In each of these roles, the vessel has proven itself more than capable, and has been one of the greatest success stories of recent Starfleet R&amp;D history.  The partnership with Nyetscape Communications would become a landmark decision, and the company would have a healthy working relationship with Starfleet for years to come.</para>
