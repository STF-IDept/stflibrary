History and Mission Overview
============================

In the early months of 2386, the Pendragon class USS Crusader NCC-86286
was on a first contact mission to a newly discovered race called the
Flea'tans. They were three species formed into an insectoid hybrid form
from the world Flea'tara, which was discovered by the USS Barret near
fleet 5 and 6's operational areas. Early in their development, an
outside alien being known only as the Elder genetically manipulated
these three separate species into the present Flea'tans that were met.
The Flea'tans eventually ceased their worship of The Elder as their
deity and the being was eventually lost to the ages of passing time.
Coming to the present day, the Crusader found their mission of first
contact and technology exchange halted by the return of the Elder, who
wished to use his cyborg army, attack drone ships and dreadnoughts to
eventually make a bid for conquering that area of space and beyond.

During this time, one of the Crusader’s fresh from the Academy security
and tactical officers, ensign Brando Corleone, experienced the Crusader
grow ever more outmatched by the more advanced designs of the Elder.
This experience occurred when he was forced to take command of the ship
in battle when the senior staff was knocked out. Being determined to
save lives in the future; he set about designing a long range tactical
variant battle cruiser based off the Pendragon.

Two months later the semi-roguish Section 31 division of Starfleet,
seeing that the Elder was a threat to Federation security, 'borrowed'
the specifications from Ensign Corleone's work. Shortly afterward, they
constructed the Memorial class battle cruiser, in secret, through their
contacts and resources in Starfleet.

After action reports of the ‘Destiny Paradox’ from the USS Dresden
temporarily assigned to Fleet 6, showed the prowess and durability in
the face of overwhelming odds that the Memorial class could bring to
Federation interests. Starfleet, after being briefed on the performance
of the class in battle and in other areas, finally approved the
construction officially of the Memorial class long range tactical battle
cruiser to supplement the Prometheus class.

Mission Profiles
----------------

The Memorial class battle cruiser is suited to the following mission
profiles:

Long range fleet support, combat actions, patrols and exploration
Command & Control of combat engagements
Urban Pacification / Policing duties
Secured diplomatic conferences
With mission modules equipped the Memorial class can also fit the
following profiles:

Troop Transport
Orbital to Ground Support Operations
Secured transport of diplomatic officials
Structure and Construction
==========================

The saucer is V shaped with an angular teardrop engineering hull
blending out of it. Coming up in a 90 degree arc are the ship’s two
static pylon nacelles. Situated in between both pylons is the ship’s
single mission module.

The Memorial utilizes a tritanium alloy hull triple layered and
reinforced with cross members built from a further tritanium alloy
support structure. Inside each hull layer is a 3 cm thick hardened foam
padding of duranium. The ship was then transporter welded along the
whole frame to reinforce the ship’s superstructure and reduce
construction time.

The Memorial is covered with 8 centimeters of ablative armor outside and
another 2 centimeters of tritanium layered reinforcement inside. Coupled
with higher powered and layered structural integrity fields, this gives
the Memorial class a high degree of damage resistance in combat and
extreme maneuvers.

The entire deck line and hull structure of the Memorial class spans 21
decks.

Mission Modules
===============

Ensign Brando Corleone and Section 31 included into the design a dome
shaped mission module. This module, which allows the Memorial-class to
expand its usual mission profiles, is positioned on decks 8-14 in
between the ship's warp nacelle pylons.

By default the Memorial's module area is a cargo module.

The available modules are as follows:

Cargo Module
:   In this configuration the module contains an open six deck cargo bay
    area for extended storage of parts and mission supplies.

Diplomatic Mission Module
:   In this configuration the Memorial gains expanded diplomatic suites.
    This module takes three days to install. When installed it gives:

    Six Ambassadorial quarters.
    Twenty-four staff quarters.
    Two conference hall complexes with bar and mess area for 40 guests.
    Six twelve seat briefing rooms.
    Facilities and quarters, for up to 25 members of the press.
    All areas are capable of supporting H, K, or L environments.
Security / Marine Transport and launch module
:   In this configuration the Memorial gains expanded security or marine
    personnel complete with their auxiliary craft and supplies.This
    module takes four days to install.

    Additional security personnel or marines for up to 55 personnel and
    supplies.
    Needed quarters and training areas for personnel.
    Two Longevity class runabouts and a launch bay.
    Two six-person transporter rooms with support and power systems.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems
==================================

Sensor Systems
--------------

The Memorial mounts the Class 9 sensor system. The system has a maximum
high resolution range out to 4.34 light years, and a low resolution
range out to 15 light years. The system includes the Emissions Tracking
System by default. This allows the Memorial class a better chance at
detecting cloaked ships with improperly configured or damaged cloaking
devices.

### Computer Core / Network systems / ENINTADI AI

The Memorial comes with two isolinear data storage computer cores
enhanced with bio-neural circuitry processors to speed up response
times. The cores are located in a straight line down the ship's
structure on decks 4-7 and 9-11.

The class comes equipped with bio-neural circuitry as its primary mode
of operation, and backup isolinear circuitry for secondary and backup
systems.

A final addition of programming by Section 31 was a tactical oriented,
self aware neural AI called Enhanced Neural Image, Navigational,
Tactical and Defense Intelligence or ENINTADI by the Section 31
developers. This neural AI when activated, named itself Entity.

This self aware neural AI coordinates all ship navigation,
tactical-offensive and defensive systems. Though automatic control of
the ship by ENINTADI is possible by voice commands, this procedure can
only be activated by both of the ship’s ranking commanding and executive
officers. By default, however, ENINTADI advises tactical and security
personnel on such related matters. The AI also coordinates the ship’s
security anti-hacking and virus protocols and when ordered will attempt
to perform similarly on enemy vessels. This gives the Memorial class a
higher resistance to enemy computer core infiltration attempts in
combat, as well as possible alien virus infection.

This neural AI is made up of some of the finest tactical and security
minded advisers in the Federation and its allies. Furthermore, its
computer software and neural routines are adaptive and will expand and
learn the longer it operates.

Although Section 31's initial AI program named itself 'Entity', no two
ENINTADI programs will behave exactly alike. As such, the AI program's
names and personality will vary from ship to ship.

ENINTADI co-runs beside the LCARS 7.0 interface.

### Holographic Systems

The Memorial comes with holo-emitters across all decks, Jeffries tubes
and other small areas and can support up to two Mark IV female EMH
programs. One program is located in each core.

Warp Propulsion Systems
=======================

The Memorial mounts a single Class 9 warp core, which feeds the ship's
two warp nacelles. This core produces 3,053 Cochranes and is able to
propel the Memorial class at a cruising speed of warp 7.0, a max
cruising speed of warp 9.6, a max velocity speed for 12 hours of Warp
9.975 and an emergency speed of warp 9.985.

Impulse Propulsion Systems
==========================

The Memorial mounts four impulse engines, though only two are used at
any given time for maneuvering. The remaining two are used as auxiliary
power reactors and for battle situations that require high speed attack
runs. They are mounted on the aft end of the ship with two on decks 4-5,
and one each on decks 10-11 and 15-16. The engines have a maximum
combined velocity of .25c, and can propel the entire ship to full
impulse in 40 seconds and a full stop in 45 seconds when coupled with
its many RCS thrusters. This setup allows the Memorial class a high
degree of maneuverability compared to other vessels of its size.

Tactical Systems
================

Defensive Shields
-----------------

The Memorial mounts the Type 11 shield system. Emitters are placed in
key positions along the whole width and breadth of the ship's frame. The
maximum graviton load that can be sustained is 2,419 Megawatts and a
maximum dissipation rate of 6.6x10\^5 megawatts. The system also
contains metaphasic programming for close solar body entry when in
combat, pursuit or retreat from enemy forces.

Phaser Systems
--------------

The Memorial uses twelve Type 10 phaser arrays. They are arrayed as
follows:

Four arrays are located dorsally and ventrally along the ship’s saucer
in a double U pattern. These strips contain 200 emitters each.
Two arrays are located forward and aft along the underbelly of the
engineering hull. These strips contain 75 emitters each.
Two arrays are located dorsally and ventrally along the aft end of the
ship. These strips contain 75 emitters each.
Two arrays run along the port and starboard sides of the engineering
hull below the saucer. These strips contain 75 emitters each.
Two arrays are located port and starboard on each nacelle pylon with 25
emitters each.
Each Type 10 strip can output 5.1 Megawatts out to 300,000 kilometers.

Torpedo Systems
---------------

The Memorial carries four Type 6 burst fire torpedo launchers. Each is
capable of launching 12 torpedoes every 8 seconds. Three are located
forward on decks 9 and 10, with a single rear firing launcher on the
same deck.

The ship carries 120 photon torpedoes, 120 quantum torpedoes, 50
scientific probes, 5 Tricobalt devices and 5 empty casings.

The three systems have a maximum effective range of 3,500,000 km.

Command and Support Systems
===========================

Bridge
------

Unlike other starship designs the Memorial’s bridge is located on deck
8. This was to ensure better protection during combat, which given the
after action reports of heavy combat from the Crusader's crew was a
needed asset.

Access is gained via two turbolifts at the forward section of the bridge
to port and starboard. The bridge is laid out in a square pattern with
the Commanding Officer, Executive Officer and Counselor situated along
the aft end of the bridge facing forward. In front and to port are the
Chief Engineer and Chief Science Officer stations. In front and to
starboard are the Chief of Security and Chief Tactical Officer stations.
Directly forward of them are the combined Operation and Helm stations.
Directly port and starboard of the Commanding Officer, Executive Officer
and Counselor are two Auxiliary stations able to be setup as mission
needs, or expanded personnel require. At the forward section of the
bridge in between both turbolifts is the main view screen.

Ready Room
----------

The ready room is located to the aft port side of the bridge; it holds a
general work area for the CO, with a desk, chair and couch, with room
for personal effects.

Briefing Room
-------------

Located to the forward starboard side of the bridge, just aft from the
turbolift, is the briefing room. The table can fit up to 12 occupants,
and contains three briefing monitors.

Brig Complex
------------

The brig complex for the Memorial is contained on deck 14 port, and can
hold up to 50 prisoners or trouble makers if needed.

Security Office / Armory / Security Training Complex / COS’s Office
-------------------------------------------------------------------

These areas are located on deck 11. The armory contains enough stores to
arm the whole ship's crew with Type 2 phasers, and enough Type 3 rifles
and variable setting grenades for 75 security members of the Memorial's
crew. Located next to both areas is the ship’s security training complex
with holoprojector training ranges.

Science Labs / Chief Science Officer's Office
---------------------------------------------

Though not meant as a dedicated science ship, the Memorial does contain
expanded science labs compared to other combat-oriented designs. All
along decks 10-12 are the various scientific labs. These include 6
general science, 2 astrology, 2 geology, 2 temporal physics, 1
astrometrics and 3 combat research labs. The CSO's office is located on
deck 10.

Engineering / Chief Engineer’s Office
-------------------------------------

Engineering is situated on decks 13-14. The CE’s office is located on
deck 14, which looks up to the ship's warp core. There are engineering
labs placed along deck 14. The two deck room is laid out in a large
circle with six consoles to each primary compass point detailing present
system status. A master systems display resides just left of the CE’s
office door. In an emergency this room can double as a secondary bridge.

JAG / Intel Office
------------------

The Memorial has a dedicated JAG/Intel office located on deck 13. The
office contains up links to all department head offices and labs to
coordinate crime or intel research. This dual purpose office is only
used when such personnel are assigned to the ship.

Utility Systems
===============

Cargo Bays
----------

The Memorial contains four large, two deck cargo bays situated on decks
16 and 17, and six smaller, single-deck bays on decks 5, 6, 18 and 19.
Each large bay contains a cargo transporter, and has exterior access
doors for umbilical connection loading at starbases. The smaller
single-deck bays on decks 5 and 6 are often given over for crew storage
needs. The cargo bays on decks 18 and 19, however, are given to sole use
of the ship's fighter crews for spare parts, as well as the ship's
Marine contingent for their specialized equipment.

Tractor Beam Systems
--------------------

The Memorial holds a single tractor emitter on deck 21 aft. The emitter
can handle a total mass of 500,000 mt out to 1,500 km.

Transporter Systems
-------------------

The Memorial has ten transporter rooms, which are capable of
transporting six people each. Two transporter rooms are on deck 3, two
are on deck 9 and six are on deck 20. Each standard transporter system
has a range of 40,000 km. The rooms on deck 20 are mainly reserved for
the use of the ship's marines for use in boarding actions. The ship is
capable of transporting up to 36 marines every one minute to a single
targeted location.

Machine Shop
------------

The Memorial's machine shop is located on decks 16-17 in between the
ship's two cargo bays.

Crew Support Systems
====================

Sickbay / Chief Medical Officer's Office
----------------------------------------

The Memorial contains two sickbays both of equal size on decks 7 and 13.
They each hold 5 bio beds and 2 surgery areas, with each containing 2
medical labs which can double as an investigative crime suite. The CMO’s
Office is located in Sickbay 1 on deck 7, able to monitor all patient
and staff’s current statuses.

Holodecks / Holosuites
----------------------

The Memorial comes with three holosuites and three holodecks. The
holosuites are located along the outer edge of decks 7, 9 and 20. The
holodecks are located on decks, 7-8, 9-10, and 20-21.

CO / XO / 2-forward Observation Areas
-------------------------------------

Arrayed on deck one are three domed shaped rooms that allow the CO, XO,
and ceiling area of 2-Forward to see out into space from above. The area
extends out forward from deck 1 in a half diamond shape. The CO and XO
private observation areas allow for a private area to relax and unwind.
These areas are privately set up for the sole use of the CO and XO.

2-Forward
---------

2-Forward is as named located on deck 2 forward of the saucer. The room
contains four replicators, two to each side of the room, and 15 tables
of varying size and shapes. A pair of stairs allows the main area of
2-Forward to access the upper observation area above on deck 1.

CO Quarters
-----------

The CO’s Quarters are located on deck 7 port and as expected are the
largest. It is divided into three areas. In this case a
bedroom/bathroom, a living area, and a work/eating area.

XO Quarters
-----------

The XO’s Quarters are located on deck 9 starboard, and are slightly
smaller than the CO’s. The room like the CO's is divided into the same
three areas.

Department Head Quarters
------------------------

The DH quarters are located in a ring around deck 3. These are smaller
than the XO’s quarters and are divided likewise into the same three
areas, just smaller.

Junior Officers Quarters
------------------------

The JO Quarters are located all along decks 6, 7, 9, 10, 16 and 17. They
are arranged into two areas, a bedroom/bathroom, and living/work area.

Non-Commissioned Crew Quarters
------------------------------

These quarters are each just slightly smaller than the JO quarters they
are located on decks 5, 11 and 18. They are a single open living and
work area with a bathroom shared between every other pair of rooms.

General Purpose Areas
---------------------

The Memorial's general purpose areas are located on decks 18, 19 and 20
forward of the ship's shuttle/fighter bay. These three large areas are
only sparsely completed to allow the crew to refit internal areas for
new experiments, rooms, or personnel as ship mission needs require. They
do not however allow mounting of external devices at any time. Commonly
these three areas are used to house up to a reinforced platoon size of
marines on the Memorial.

Auxiliary Spacecraft Systems
============================

Shuttle / Fighter Bay
---------------------

The Memorial carries a combination shuttle / fighter bay. This bay spans
decks 18-20 just aft of the general purpose areas and contain modular
bay setups to allow a variety of auxiliary craft to be mounted with a
starbase layover.

It is a through-deck bay able, to house up to the following amounts of
support / fighter craft depending on mission profile needs:

Default auxiliary load-out is:

2x Armadillo-class shuttles
5x Longevity-class runabouts
However this can be changed to include the following auxiliary craft for
particular mission needs or Commanding Officer preferences:

8x Armadillo-class shuttles
Or

6 Longevity-class Runabouts

Conclusion
==========

The Memorial class allows Starfleet to project a strong show of force
where needed, without the cost and supplies required for the larger
dreadnoughts. The ship also contains the necessary areas to allow uses
besides straight up combat.
