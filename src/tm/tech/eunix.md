Description
===========

The EUNIX system is a network of processing nodes spread throughout a
starship. Standard fiberoptic cables are used to transmit between nodes
and between sub-nodes within each processing node. ODN conduits between
nodes are encased in a subspace field sustainer which allows data to
transmit at FTL velocities. Each node is a bank of processors in and of
itself. Depending on the purpose of the node, its composition varies
from almost completely bioneural to completely isolinear. Bioneural
circuitry is used for specialized, repeated tasks, from shield
modulation to warp core monitoring. Isolinear units are used for higher
processing requirements. Isolinear and bioneural sub-nodes are used
concurrently in combinations deemed most suited to the tasks assigned
each node.

Also, the multiple nodes provide backup and support for other nodes.
There are virus blocks between each node and due to the
de-centralization of processing, rendering the computer inoperable is
impossible for all but the most skilled intruders with access to
high-level codes.

Nodes are placed in space that might otherwise be useless, while the
space normally taken up by bulky processing cores is used instead for
other functions.

A programming glitch gives the EUNIX computer system a thick Scottish
burr. Other than that, software functions as per spec.
