Description
===========

This weapon system is designed to a multitude of operations these are
listed below:

Fire support: This can either via automatic operation or via manual
operation.
Area denial: Weapon can be placed into a specific area and told to deny
access to this area, provisions can be made for authorised personnel to
enter and leave area.
Base defense: Can be used to defend a permanent or temporary
installation against attack.
Weapon specifications:
======================

Dimensions

Height: 1.2 meters
Length: 1.5 meters
Width: 1 meter
Device arrangement:

The weapon system is built on a tripod mount, allowing for maximum
stability. The weapon itself is allowed to rotate the full 360 degrees
and can be elevated up to 45 degrees and lowered to -45 degrees, which
prevents the turret from hitting the tripod mount. Its body is cast from
solid duridium providing sufficient armor against most energy and
projectile weaponry. There are three batteries, one in each tripod leg.

Power source:

There are 3 on-board batteries with varying lifespans dependent upon
use. There is a slot in the head of each "foot" of the turret for a main
power supply. This will automatically override the on-board power supply
(batteries), unless the power supplied drops below the required level
for operation, in which case said power supply will be used to
supplement the batteries. The various batteries, each of which are
labeled on the exterior of each leg, are as follows:

1.  Battery 1: Located at the base of leg "A", it supplies the optics,
    sensors and control systems to provide an operational standby life
    span of three days. Active tracking and engagement mode cuts the
    battery's life span to one day of continues usage.
2.  Battery 2: Located at the base of leg "B", this supplies power to
    the attached weapon and allowing for continual firing of standard
    phaser fire of up to level seven for one day. Dual batteries allow
    for "field replacement" of one battery while the other provides
    power. Each battery provides power for continual phaser fire of up
    to roughly 12 hours.
3.  Battery 3: Located at the base of leg "B", this battery serves as
    the other part of the dual battery set-up with Battery 2.

Sensors:

Multiple sensors are built on board the weapon system and are mounted in
armored positions to protect against destruction by enemy fire. These
are located half way up each tripod leg and on various locations around
the cradle. There is also one optic sensor placed on the same axis but 5
centimeters to the right of where the weapon would sit. Auxiliary sensor
input ports are located on the underside of the tripod assembly,
specifically where the 3 legs meet. This allows for extra sensors to be
connected to the device for more precise operations.

On board sensors have multiple types, including infrared, motion
tracking, night vision, electromagnetic (EM) sensors, and standard
optical video units.

Control:

The unit is controlled by isolinear circuitry located on the lower half
of the rear of the device. This is heavily armored and is difficult to
replace in the field due to the multiple connections the entire unit has
to the various subsystems. Changing control chips is a simple process of
opening the control unit cover but further component replacement
requires specialist tools. The weapon system can be either be controlled
remotely from a standard tricorder, manually by a trigger system on the
actual mounted weapon, or by a starship in orbit. It can also be left in
standby mode to fire on a number of pre-selected variables.

Weapons:

The system can be equipped with:

1.  Type IIIa Phaser Rifle
2.  Type IIIb Phaser Rifle
3.  Type IIIc Pulse Compression Phaser Rifle
4.  TR-116 Projectile Rifle
5.  Type IIId Pulse Compression Phaser Rifle- EVA version\*

\* Note: Reserved for use in EVA environments.

The weapon is to be slotted into its "cradle", basically a small housing
with a gap at the rear for the trigger. The power cell and optics on the
weapon are to be removed before the device is inserted then once the
weapon is seated correctly the power-supply and optics connector is to
be pushed down into place via its barrel hinge arrangement.

Optical display:

The optical display will present the user with all the data acquired
from the weapon, power supply and sensors. This unit itself is a
precision piece of equipment and thus field repairs are ill-advised.
Replacement is done via removing the pin in the barrel hinge and lifting
the unit out.

Portability:

The device can be erected by a 3 man team within 10 minutes, providing
enough time for operational checks to be done on the devices sensors,
weapons and control systems. This amount of time is needed due to the
complex workings of the device and to ensure that the device's IFF
system is accurate.

A "plug and play" set-up can be done within 5 minutes, though this is
not recommended as this bypasses all safety checks and activates the
weapon ready for use as a manually-operated turret.

Transport:

This weapon can be transported in its supplied cases or by hand via
carry handles on the various devices, although not using a case does
leave several usually unexposed areas of the device exposed to the
elements.

Conclusion:
===========

This device should meet the current stop gap in starfleet ground based
security applications, as further versions are in design for heavier
weapons. This device is designed for both regular Starfleet and
Starfleet Marine Corps use. Its portability and small size it allow for
even a small starship to carry several. This device is also aimed at
relieving the ever present issue of lack of manpower which tends to
arise in combat engagements.
