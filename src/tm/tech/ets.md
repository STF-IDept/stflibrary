Description
===========

Emissions Tracking units are dedicated sensor units, designed to detect
and trace the emissions of other craft (such as warp trails, impulse
emissions, etc). Once detected, the ETS locates and locks onto the
source of these emissions, providing an improved sensor lock when used
with traditional systems. The system allows limited cloak detection
against under-rated or damaged cloaking systems, but is useless against
intact cloaking devices. This only provides detection, not a way to
de-cloak the craft.
