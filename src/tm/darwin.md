History and Mission Overview
============================

On Stardate 96010.1, Starfleet Command authorized what may be the first
"mass-produced" capital ship design. Based on a need to develop a new
generation of light, fast vessels for exploration and patrol purposes, a
design team was enlisted to create a design to balance the need for
rapid deployment with the necessity of a quality vessel.

The critical breakthrough was the modular units, which could be easily
constructed, or even replicated as needed. The only portions of the
vessel which are not fully modular are the engine core, and the
spaceframe.

The first prototype of this design, the USS Darwin, was constructed at
the Larimda Me Prototype Yards, of the Starbase 117 complex, in the Beta
Priori Starsystem. It was be immediately placed into active service for
testing, while the construction of the next four vessels awaited. After
construction began on this first "batch", the semi-completed vessels
were pressed into service as part of a task force to apprehend the thief
of a transwarp-capable runabout, USS Pursuit. After the conclusion of
this action, the remaining 37 vessels in the contract were produced over
the course of two and a half years. While its battle skills are fairly
questionable, it still is more than a match for most problems that would
be encountered, and its mere existance will allow the more powerful
designs to be freed from the more mundane exploration and survey
missions.

Beginning on Stardate 01020.5, the Mark II upgrade project was
initiated. This upgrade included a readjustment to the phaser arrays to
compensate for observed phaser "shadows," a removal of the
demonstratedly useless pulse-phaser mount above the nacelles, an
increase in effective vessel range of 4%, and a significant upgrade of
the Holographic and Computer systems. These upgrades are expected to be
rapidly completed, and make the Darwin a more well-rounded vessel for
general mission.

Standard Mission Profiles for the Darwin include:

General Exploration Craft
:   The Darwin makes an ideal scout, because of its high speed, powerful
    general purpose scanners, and small size. While more in-depth
    research ought to be carried out by an Andromeda, Columbus, or
    Athens, the Darwin, with its sheer numbers, and relative
    expendability, will often be the first UFP vessel assigned to any
    research or exploration area.

First Response Vessel
:   The Darwin's speed and distibution make it likely to be one of the
    first ships to respond to disasters within and outside of the UFP.
    For this reason, the design includes slightly more medical and
    engineering personnel than would normally be assigned to a ship of
    this size, and several holographic systems as well that allow the
    ship to 'donate' more of its personnel to external duties than
    otherwise possible.

Military Scout
:   In times of warfare, the Darwin makes up for its relative lack of
    armament with its speed. It makes an fairly good reconnaissance
    vessel, able to handle quick flybys, and report on enemy status and
    strength with a high degree of accuracy. It can also be used as a
    troop transport, and a field hospital ship, because of its high
    speed. There are, of course, other ships that can handle certain
    aspects better than a Darwin, however.

Urgent Cargo Carrier
:   In ancient times, the most urgent of cargo was sent by the fastest
    available transport, whether that was by runner, horse, sailboat, or
    jet. Field Commanders have long known that the most important part
    of warfare is maintaining secure supply lines. While the Darwin is
    not very effective in slaying ones enemies, and makes a fairly poor
    convoy escort, it would be very effective when used as a cargoship
    on its own. The old adage 'you can't kill what you can't catch'
    applies strongly in this context. When it absolutely, positively,
    has to be there yesterday (and it's not too large), the Darwin will
    probably quickly become the ship of choice, at least until
    Transwarp-capable vessels of sufficient size are able to be
    constructed.

Scientific Research
:   Although the Mark II upgrade of the Darwin was completed with a
    slight decrease to the overall scientific mission, to make a more
    well-rounded vessel, the Darwin remains a highly capable vessel for
    the general mission of Starfleet, exploration and discovery.

Structure and Construction
==========================

Externally, owing to the requirements of the modular design, the vessel
is anything but sleek. The primary hull resembles more closely a
trapezoid than a saucer, with the front section arcing only very
gradually, then a sharp angular slice running down the port and
starboard sides, until the aft 'arc' is intersected again. The secondary
hull, containing the deflector dish, warp core, and other vital systems,
is mounted above, rather then below (using the orientation for planetary
landing), and is offset 50 meters behind the stern of the primary hull,
and extends 75 meters beyond the aft terminus of the primary hull.

The warp nacelles are a swing-wing configuration, mounted "below" the
primary hull. In normal cruise configuration, the angle of the nacelles
ranges from 61 to 72 degrees. At impulse configuration, in order to
minimize gravitational strain, the nacelles are set to ninety degrees,
and retracted five meters into the hull. For landing configuration, the
nacelles are extended an extra three meters, and are set to an angle of
negative five degrees, fitting inside slots at the bottom of the primary
hull, in order to prevent damage to the nacelles on landing.

The Darwin is, internally, a collection of approximately 300 separate
units, all of which are easily constructed and replaced. Some of these
modules, like the Bridge Module, are used only once per ship. Others,
like the Officer/VIP Quarters, Interior and Exterior Crew Quarters, and
the holodecks, are used many times over, and can be placed together in
an assembly-line fashion, allowing these ships to be produced at an
amazing 21% improvement over the Intrepid design, at each construction
yard. Additionally, because of the small size, two ships can be
simultaneously built inside one large vessel mooring. Because of this
design, the internal layout of the Darwin Class can be somewhat
customized at construction time as well. Conversion of the Darwin class
vessels to purely Medical, Research, or Cargo vessels, once the weaponry
and warp drive are obsolete, should require only minor changes. The
expected useful lifetime of this incarnation of the Darwin Class is
estimated a! t 30 years, with an additional 40 years afterwards
performing as more of a support (Medical, Research, etc.) ship. Refits
are projected to be at relatively low cost, compared to previous,
non-modular designs, which could signifigantly extend the useful
lifetime of the Darwin class.

The Darwin Class vessel has one front-mounted Trafalgar-style mission
module docking port, which can be exchanged at any Federation Starbase
or Outpost equipped with spare modules. The complete list of available
modules is identical to that of Trafalgar. Alternatively, the area can
also be used to store a single Valhalla or Denver Class Runabout. The
other option for this space is it's official, default status, as a
cargobay.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems
==================================

.

Sensor Systems
--------------

The sensor system on the Darwin is optimized for research purposes, but
does have capacity for tactical operation as well. High resolution range
is 4.5 light years, with a low resolution range of up to 15 light years
under optimum conditions. The Darwin carries a load of twenty-five
standard probes, which are launched via the torpedo tubes.

Computer Systems
----------------

While early Darwin vessels were a hybrid of mostly isolinear and
relatively sparse bioneural systems for their primary computer
interface, bioneural circuitry has become more abundant recently, and
the newer Darwin class vessels being constructed are 27% bioneural on
their main and primary backup systems. All critical systems have a
secondary backup on an older, isolinear design, in case of catastrophic
failure. A storage locker in Main Engineering contains 55 spare
bioneural gelpacks, for replacement and rotation.

The main computer core, Mark X, is located in the center of the primary
hull, and has a storage capacity of 2.1 teraquads. The secondary core, a
standard ODN 17Q system, is located in the primary hull, aft, and has a
storage capacity of 700 gigaquads.

The Darwin Class vessel uses the standard LCARS OS and Interface by
default. The original USS Darwin prototype, however, used a customized
derivitive called the Darwin Operating System, or DarOS. Despite the
improved computer efficiency over the LCARS system, officers and crew
found it difficult (if not impossible) to utilize the Darwin OS due to
its highly user-unfriendly interface. An overlay program was attempted
to make the Darwin OS easier to use, but the overlay constantly crashed
the computer core, and despite efforts to remedy this, the situation got
worse and worse over time, despite numerous attempts to upgrade the
overlay to correct this instability. Fortunately, DarOS was never
installed on any of the other vessels, and these problems have not been
duplicated elsewhere as a result.

Holographic Crew
----------------

The Darwin is equipped with Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH Mark IV).
Holographic officers are restricted to operation where holoemitters are
present; specifically sickbay, the holodecks, the bridge, and the brig.
Additionally, because two instances can be run simultaneously (one from
the primary computer core, and one from the secondary core), but because
of the limits of holoemitters, only one can be run in any given location
at the same time. Finally, use of any of the program continuously for
more than five hours is strongly discouraged, due to the tendency for
program corruption after extended operation.

Warp Propulsion Systems
=======================

The Darwin contains two nacelles, located below the primary hull, in a
swing-wing configuration with three preset angle settings; -5 degrees
(planetary landing configuration), the range between 61 and 72 degrees
(warp flight configuration) and 90 degrees (normal impulse flight
operation.) Zero degrees is defined as the nacelles being perfectly
parallel with the saucer section's vertical plane of symmetry. The Warp
Core is located in the Secondary Hull.

The Darwin has a standard cruising velocity of Warp 6, the velocity at
which maximum fuel efficiency is attained. It is capable of sustaining a
velocity of Warp 9.3, and has a twelve hour emergency speed of Warp
9.903.

Impulse Propulsion Systems
==========================

The Impulse drive is located at the aft portion of the secondary hull.
It can propel the vessel to a maximum safe impulse velocity of 0.287c.
(This limit is largely due to relativistic concerns rather than
technological issues.) The impuse engines achieve maximum fuel
efficiency at a cruising velocity of 0.23c and 0.0007c. As such, 0.23c
is designated "Standard Impulse," and 0.287c "Full Impulse."

Tactical Systems
================

Defensive Shields
-----------------

The shields of the Darwin Class are of the standard deflector shielding
variety, with a maximum graviton load of 1077 MW and a maximum
dissipation rate of 3.2 x 10\^4 kW.

Phaser Systems
--------------

Five Type-IX phaser arrays are located on the vessel - two arcs located
on the front side of the primary hull (top and bottom), one arc at the
rear to cover escape, and two arcs located on opposite sides of the
secondary hull to cover side approaches. There is a "359" degree
coverage with this arrangement; two small phaser "blind spots" occur in
the shadows of the warp nacelle.

The strips contain the following emitter breakdown: Top primary and
bottom primary arc contain 80 emitters each. Rear arc contains 50
emitters. The secondary hull arcs contain 70 emitters each. The total
emitter count is 350.

The maximum effective range of the Phaser systems is 250,000 km.

Torpedo Systems
---------------

The torpedo launchers are located at the front and rear of the secondary
hull, able again to cover "359" degrees of coverage using standard
fire-and-forget targetting. The launchers are physically seperate, but
share a common torpedo storage area, where 85 torpedoes are stored
(standard payload is 75 photon torpedoes, ten quantum torpedoes.) The
maximum burst-fire rate is four torpedoes per tube. The torpedo
blindspots are located at the underside of the primary hull, and
directly above the primary hull at an approach perpendicular to the
central axis.

Command and Support Systems
===========================

Bridge
------

The bridge of the Darwin-class vessel is one of the smaller designs.
Similar in some ways to the older Constitution-class design, there are
two central seats located in the rear for the Captain and First Officer.
The Tactical officer, Helmsman and Operations officer (clockwise) are
located at the front, facing front, and four work stations along the
perimeter face away from the center. Two of these are dedicated for
Engineering, Mission Operations. (the more forward on either side;
Engineering is to the Port side, Mission Ops Starboard.), and the other
two are configurable for whatever other purpose is deemed necessary for
the specific mission.

Main Science Complex
--------------------

Deck 9 houses the Main Science Complex, which includes laboratory space
for the various disciplines. The basic lab facilities include a computer
interface, and a configurable setup based on a basic template.
Individual labs can be configured for any of the sciences, from medical
to astrophysics, with only minor adjustments. 28 labs make up the
complex, in four wings (two 8-lab wings, and two 6-lab wings).

Utility Systems
===============

Cargo Bays
----------

Cargobays are located as follows: Two on Deck 4, 1 on Deck 5, 3 on Deck
11, and 2 on Deck 12. All cargobays are equiped with standard cargo
transporters. Cargobay \#4 (located at Deck 11 Forward) is unique in
that it is located on the exterior of the vessel, and can be converted
to accomodate either a Valhalla-class or Denver-Class Runabout, or a
Trafalgar-class mission module.

Tractor Beam Systems
--------------------

The tractor beam emitter is located on Deck 12. It has an effective
range of 425,000 km.

Transporter Systems
-------------------

The main transporters have a range of 42,500 km, and are located as
follows: two rooms on Deck 4, two rooms on Deck 9.

Crew Support Systems
====================

Sickbay
-------

Sickbay is located on Deck 9. It is divided into two normal six-bed
rooms, and two quarentine two-bed rooms, for a total patient capacity of
16 beds. It is located in close proximity to the main science complex,
and the medical labs are considered part of that complex.

Recreational Facilities
-----------------------

Most of the recreational facilities are located on Deck 8: These include
- two holodecks, a gymnasium, the Eight Forward Rec lounge, and the
Eight Aft obvervation lounge. VIP quarters are also located on Deck 8,
conveniently close to these activity areas.

Alternate Environmental Support
-------------------------------

Two of the VIP quarters, a small obvervation lounge, and the quarters
adjoining these three rooms, all located on the starboard side of Deck
8, are capable of sustained reproduction of most of the various
alternate atmosphere conditions. These are designed mostly for the use
of visiting scientists or diplomats, although they may also be used to
accomodate others as deemed necessary.

Auxiliary Spacecraft Systems
============================

Shuttlecraft
------------

The shuttlebay, located Deck 5 aft, is capable of holding up to the
standard compliment of four Type-12 Personnel shuttles. Cargobay 8
adjoins the shuttlebay, and can contain one additional shuttle, for
repairs, refit or storage.

Runabouts
---------

A Valhalla-class or Denver-class Runabout may be accomodated in Cargobay
4 (Deck 11) if that area is not being used for other purposes.

Captain's Yacht
---------------

The Captain's Yacht is Type Upsilon (crossreference Upsilon-Type Yacht),
and is mounted inside a grooved notch on Deck 12, which corresponds to
Deck 1 of the Yacht. A split dome hatch houses the yacht internally,
which moves away to allow the Yacht to dock or depart.
