      <para>"Yeah, you're probably right."</para>
    </epigraph>
    <para>Combat ships throughout history have been made for various odd jobs. Many projects have risen and fallen to make these ships possible. One of the companies that gave birth to a combat ship was Knight Drive Yards (KDY). Their project had strange beginnings. It was code named Project Maverick, Design Number 688-I.</para>
    <para>KDY had gotten its fame from making civilian cargo ships. In fact, the only reason they went into the contract was because of a dare. A freighter captain (who was a good friend of the designers) had heard about the project, and had taken a special interest to it. He was at a bar with a couple of designers when he mentioned it. He actually was a bit tipsy, but even then, he had very little confidence in his friends' abilities. He bet them that they couldn't make a combat ship out of his freighter, a KD-1270. The designers took up the bet, and then wound up winning. They named the revamped freighter the Maverick class (after the captain of it). The captain liked what he saw, and advised them to take it to Starfleet.</para>
    <para>The small team of designers took the captain's idea to the then-owner of KDY, Marius Jalaa, in hopes that she would accept it. She agreed to take a look at their ship design, wondering why she should even consider the Maverick as workable by KDY. After a meeting, they agreed to expand the design team, as well as the R&amp;D department of KDY, for the sole purpose of developing the Maverick. Unfortunately, they saw a few flaws in the original design. For one, the combat equipment that they'd put into it was outdated, and other components of the ship were very inefficient. They went back to the drawing board, and eventually found that the KD-1270 was the wrong kind of ship to support a combat rig. They abandoned the entire idea of using the freighter, but they still kept the name because the Captain had brought them into the project. </para>
    <para>They proposed the new dreadnought to Starfleet. Starfleet had been looking for a replacement for the venerable Nimitz class dreadnought, and so they accepted the concept. After that, KDY and Starfleet made entire design teams just for the purpose of making individual systems, or at least determining where they would go. The hull outlines were made, and the entire crew decided upon the one that they thought to be best for the job. Starfleet used its design teams to influence the overall design, as well as provide any information from Memory Alpha that was needed by the KDY designers. Starfleet and KDY eventually wound up combining their teams together for the sake of efficiency.</para>
    <para>Seven years later, all of the design teams came together in one giant meeting. Along with Marius Jalaa and a few Admirals, they looked at what they all had come up with. The hull looked more like an exploration ship than a combat vessel, but it was actually a very clever disguise on the hull designing team. The rest of the systems had been patterned off the most advanced Starfleet knowledge available from Memory Alpha and the Daystrom Institute Technical Library, and then tweaked a bit so as to get more power and efficiency out of them. The Maverick was finally complete in their eyes, as well as the eyes of the company owner. After ownership was given over to Starfleet, the Commander-in-Chief decided to construct the ship. They finished building the first Maverick class two years after they finished the design. They named the ship the USS Paris during its prototype phase, but was redesignated the USS Maverick after its shakedown run and different testing missions.</para>
    <para>The Maverick can be used in rescue missions, combat patrols, starbase and convoy defense, wartime attacks and patrols and protection of an exploration convoy or ship. The Maverick is designed for heavy combat, and if needed, commanding a fleet of starships. It is a ship of the line, and one of the best dreadnoughts as of yet.</para>

      <para>"They'd probably think nobody would be that stupid."</para>
    </epigraph>
    <para>The Maverick has a new hull design altogether. The Maverick is made of a duranium/tritanium double hull and a titanium superstructure. The entire Maverick is comprised of 32 decks. These 32 decks consist of a 23-deck dish and a 29-deck main hull. Of the decks of the dish, 19 are also combined with the upper decks of the hull. The dish is ovular, and the impulse drives are at the rear of it. It resembles the Sovereign class dish, but shares no real parts with it. To specify even more, decks 1 through 4 are on the saucer only, decks 5 through 23 are on both parts of the ship, and decks 24 through 32 are only part of the main hull.</para>
    <para>The Maverick has 2 cm of ablative armor over all of the ship. There is and extra 2 cm over the Main Bridge, making that part of the ship covered by 4 cm of ablative armor. Ablative armor is only a temporary defense, since every time it takes a hit, some of it burns away. That means that every time the Maverick is in a combat situation where the hull is hit, the ablative armor there needs to be replaced. There is also some regular tritanium armor under the ablative armor. Finally, every section of the ship is reinforced with titanium, and while titanium may be the weakest of the current metals, it is easy to replace.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Sensors</title>
      <para>The sensors are the same as Starfleet standard. They go out to 17 light years in medium to low resolution, and can go out to 5 light years in high resolution. Because the Maverick is a tactical ship, the close-range sensors are often given more power than the long-range sensors, except when the Maverick is sent out on a mission alone.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Computer Systems</title>
      <para>The computing systems aboard the Maverick consist of three isolinear chip cores located in various points around the ship. Core A is on decks 6-10, Core B is on decks 13-17 and Core C is on decks 18-22. The entire system has the Starfleet Library Computer Access and Retrieval System, version 3.1 installed.</para>

    <title>Warp Propulsion Systems</title>
    <epigraph>
      <attribution>Luke Skywalker</attribution>
      <para>"Can she go fast?"</para>
    </epigraph>
    <para>The Maverick's Warp Propulsion System is comprised of one KDY Mk 10 Warp Core feeding two nacelles. The Maverick can go at a maximum speed of Warp 9.405 for 12 hours. This may not be fast, considering the speed of some other ships, but since it's a large warship, speed isn't really that much of an issue unless it's trying to retreat. The Maverick is only capable of sustaining a maximum speed of Warp 8, but the same rule for speed applies. It has a cruising speed of Warp 6. It has an output of 1,500+ cochranes.</para>
    <para>The deuterium tanks are stored on Deck 20, as well as the Fuel Pumps, Fill Ports, and Injector Reactors for the deuterium. The antimatter Injector Reactors are on Deck 24. The Storage Pods for the antimatter are on Decks 27 and 28.</para>

      <attribution>Han Solo</attribution>
      <para>"It's the ship that made the Kessel run in twelve parsecs."</para>
    </epigraph>
    <para>The impulse propulsion system is made of two KDY Space Quester Impulse Engines, powering 2 KDY IHOP (Impulse High OutPut) impulse units, located on decks 9, 10, and 11. These impulse engines are a standard design, which KDY uses on most of its ships. They can propel the ship at 0.25c. While this is fast for regular Starfleet standards, the Maverick still doesn't maneuver well. The Maverick's impulse engines can go to full impulse in 18 seconds and go to full stop in 36 seconds. They are positioned at the back of the dish area, which is a standard location. Most KDY clients request these engines, and so the Yards decided that they would be ideal for the Maverick.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Defensive Shields</title>
      <para>There are five different KDY PDS combat shielding arrays placed in different locations on the ship. There are two located on Deck 20 on the rear port and rear starboard. The other three arrays are located on decks 10, 11, and 12. The maximum graviton load of these combined arrays is 3150 MW. The primary energy dissipation rate of these combined arrays is 8.6 x 10^5 kW.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Phaser Systems</title>
      <para>There are 14 Type X phaser arrays in total on the Maverick. On the front of the ship, there are 8 phaser arrays. 4 of them are dorsal, and 4 of them are ventral. Each forward array has 200 emitters on it, and each emitter has a power output of 5.2 MW. They all have an arc of 240º. There are 6 rear Type X phaser arrays. 4 of them are dorsal, and 2 of them are ventral. Each rear array has 175 emitters on it, and each emitter has a power output of 5.0 MW. They all have an arc of 200º. The maximum range of each emitter is 300,000 km.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Torpedo Systems</title>
      <para>The Maverick has 3 forward launchers located on decks 18-20. All three are ventral launchers, each capable of firing 7 projectiles in rapid succession. It also has three rear launchers. Two are dorsal and is located on decks 19-21. One is ventral and is located on deck 24-26. All of them are capable of firing 6 projectiles in rapid succession. The Maverick holds a total of 600 varied torpedoes. The tubes can also be refit to launch probes. The Maverick holds 100 standard probes, but the torpedo casings aboard the Maverick can be rigged up as probes. The maximum range that the launchers can project the torpedoes is 3,600,000 km.</para>

    <section>
      <title>War Room</title>
      <para>The War Room is a combat situation room where the need to see an entire fleet is required. It is located on Deck 1. It allows for easier fleet command in large combat engagements. It can also be used as a conference room. This room has a table with a display-type holoemitter in the middle of it. This holo-emitter can display the entire engagement, or just a small section of it.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Auxiliary Bridge</title>
      <para>This Bridge is a Bridge designed just in case something goes wrong on the Main Bridge and it is unable to function correctly. It is connected directly to the Main Bridge by a dedicated turbolift. It takes away distractions of Engineers running around. It is located on Deck 18, sufficiently far away from the upper levels so that the command staff can abandon ship before anything wrong on the upper decks reaches them.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Brigs</title>
      <para>The Primary Brig is located on Deck 10, and there are Secondary and Tertiary Brigs on Deck 11. They are smaller so that Deck 11 can support a larger Shuttle Bay. They are across from some maintenance areas primarily used by Engineering. During wartime, the Maverick class brig takes in many POWs. The rest of the time, it holds mainly regular criminals.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>COS' Office</title>
      <para>Connected to the Primary Brig, the COS' Office provides constant updates on the state of security aboard the ship, as well as updates on the Security personnel. It provides constant displays of the internal sensors so that the COS can tell if there's a stowaway within the ship.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Armory</title>
      <para>There is an extensive Armory that takes up 1/8 of Deck 12. It is directly across the hall from the Shuttle Bay. It contains personnel weapons ranging from hand phasers to tetryon rifles, as well as body armor for troops. There are three locker rooms for each kind of weapon, as well as sarium-krellide power cells, or whatever is needed to power the weapons used. This allows the Maverick to have some ground assault capability via shuttles, rather than dedicated transport ships.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Science Labs</title>
      <para>The Science Labs aboard the Maverick aren't that large, considering that the Maverick is a combat vessel. There are three Science Labs of limited size located on Deck 8. They are for only general purposes. Extensive laboratories such as Astrometrics and Stellar Cartography are not included because on a combat ship, they would be a waste of space. The CSO's Office is connected to Lab One, and can access all information on current assignments of the Science Department, status of the assignments, and status of Science personnel. This office also provides sensor readouts to the CSO.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Engineering</title>
      <para>Engineering has three levels: Upper Engineering, Main Engineering, and Lower Engineering. They are on Decks 21-23, respectively. The reaction chamber of the warp core, which is three decks in heaight, is contained within these three areas. This allows Engineering to keep constant watch over the entire warp core. There is an Auxiliary Engineering Control Room on Deck 28, located next to the Fighter Pilots' Quarters, should Engineering be inaccessible.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>CE's Office</title>
      <para>The CE's office has its walls lined with information on vital systems of the ship. It is located on Deck 22, and is connected to Main Engineering. The CE can access any of these information outputs from his desk. He can also access the status of non-vital systems and status of all Engineers on board from this desk.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Training Rooms</title>
      <para>Located on Deck 27, the Training Rooms include a Shooting Range (SR) and a Simulated Combat Area (SCA). They are used by Security. While the Combat Area and Shooting Range may be an inefficient use of space, it is a power saver. The only thing that uses power that wouldn't already be being used would be the lighting and simulation suits in these areas. The shooting range consists of a long field area with holographic targets using one wall. The wall is a partial hologrid. Fake phasers emitting a visible beam are used. When the visible beam hits the holographic target, the target does what it would actually do in real life. The SCA consists of a floor that can vary in height, as well as hologram projectors, which give the illusion of something, but have no real depth. The fake phasers are used in here as well.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Conference Rooms</title>
      <para>The Conference Rooms are two rooms that are separated by a removable bulkhead, allowing for the chambers to be combined for larger capacity. They can vary in purpose. They are located on Deck 9. The rooms can be converted from a treaty negotiation room to a courtroom in a matter of minutes. The purposes of these rooms are to be a courtroom, a treaty negotiation area, a promotion hall, a party area, and possibly a second crew lounge. It all depends on how it is set up, and what is put inside it.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Cargo Bays</title>
      <para>The Maverick has 8 cargo bays. They are primarily used for parts storage (phaser emitter replacements, engine parts, isolinear chips, etc.), but sometimes are used to carry extra ground combat weapons when the Armory can't provide enough firepower for special missions. There is one cargo transporter per cargo bay. The cargo bays are standard size. Cargo Bays 1 through 4 take up half of Deck 19, and Cargo Bays 5 through 8 take up half of Deck 26.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Tractor Beam Systems</title>
      <para>Tractor Beam:
The tractor beam emitters are located on decks 8 and 25, and each are placed on a small turret. They are forward facing. They have a range of 20,000 km, and an angle of 145°.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Transporter Systems</title>
      <para>There are paired transporter rooms on Decks 5, 6, and 7, as well as emergency transporters near frequented areas and vital locations on the ship. They are standard Starfleet issue transporters. The regular transporters have a range of 40,000 km, and the emergency transporters have a range of 14,500 km.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Holographic Systems</title>
      <para>There are four holosuites contained on decks 7 and 8 so that the Maverick can offer many sorts of simulations to keep the crew entertained. There are also simulations in the holodecks that simulate exercise gyms, or athletic fields and courts. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Lounges</title>
      <para>On deck 8 (8-Forward), there is a Crew Lounge that works as a mess hall and just a general meeting area for the crew. There is also an observation Lounge on Deck 3. This provides a wide range of entertainment for the people aboard the Maverick.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Exercise Facilities</title>
      <para>There is one Gym located on Deck 12. It takes up 1/8 of Deck 12, allowing for the maximum amount of people to exercise at a time. The gym was considered a top priority due to the fact that the crew's duties would require a lot of physical strength. The gym has weights, exercise machines, and even a holographic image projector that instructs people in self-defense, exercise routines, and even the martial arts.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Quarters</title>
      <para>The quarters of different crewmembers are of different size and luxuriousness. These quarters can support many environments besides that of an M class planet (e.g. H, K, L, etc.). The CO and the XO have the largest quarters on the ship. They both have two couches, a desk, replicators, a table, a large bed, a restroom, and a closet. The Senior Officer's Quarters are about 5/8 the size of the CO's quarters. They are also very comfortable, with most of the things of the CO's quarters, save for one couch and a desk. The Junior Officer's quarters provide some individual comforts, but have only a small table, some chairs, a replicator, a closet, a bed, and a restroom. The regular Crew Quarters are rather cramped, and are designed to hold two or four people each, depending on size. Each has one or two bunk beds, a closet, a small restroom, and a small table with some chairs. These quarters serve basically as functional sleeping areas, but can also be an eating area.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Sickbay</title>
      <para>Sickbay is located on Deck 3. It is a standard Starfleet Sickbay, designed for a combat ship. There are 50 bio-beds in Sickbay, each capable of showing vital statistics of each patient. Sickbay can support one EMH Mark IV with a SWEDE upgrade. Obviously, this EMH usually isn't put into use that much, but if the Medical staff are injured, or, quite possibly, killed, the EMH is able to go into action, even though it is restricted to the holodecks and Sickbay. The CMO's office is designed to give status of all patients. It also has a Medical database and the ability to access the status of all the Medical personnel.</para>

    <para>The Main Shuttle Bay is positioned on Decks 11 and 12. It can accommodate 7 shuttle pods or 4 shuttles. The shuttle bay has side-by-side doors so that two shuttlepods or shuttles can be launched at a time. The Maverick is usually given the compliment of shuttles so that it can transport more personnel in a single craft.</para>
    <para>Shuttle Bays 2 and 3 are on top of one another on the very bottom of the ship (located on decks 29-30 and 31-32 respectively). They are two decks in height, and each has a single launch door. They both can support 5 shuttle pods or 2 shuttles.</para>

    <para>The Maverick is designed to be a front line ship, capable of surviving multiple combat engagements in a row. It is very powerful, but not unreasonable to construct. It can take a hit, and still survive. Unless considerably outnumbered or faced with superior technology, it should be able to win a battle or escape to fight again another day.</para>
