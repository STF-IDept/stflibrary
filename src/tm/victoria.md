History and Mission Overview
============================

At the end of the Dominion War, Starfleet command was forced to deal
with the consequences from the years of war, conflict, and skirmishes;
Starfleet Defense was left in all but ruins. However, the conclusion of
this major war brought peace for the time being, so the task of
rebuilding became the foremost concern of Starfleet command.

The diminished defenses increased the risk of infiltration from Breen,
Romulans, Sheliak, and similar species; Starfleet required ships that
were capable while easily produced yet adhered to the principles of
exploration and versatility that made the Federation what it is, such as
the Intrepid and the Kearsarge. Star-fleet R&D opened the contract for
new designs to it's closed network of independents, which included the
newly formed Green Council, Intergalactic (better known as GCI). GCI
contributed the Victoria, designed to incorporate the best features from
several designs into a compact, self-sufficient ship.

The Victoria, as proposed by GCI's starship R&D, is essence of
versatility. Armed for defense, but designed for long range diplomatic,
research, and exploratory missions, primary mission profiles include:

-   Long range, Deep Space Exploration

-   Short range exploration and investigation

-   Scientific Research and Evaluation

-   Diplomatic Missions

-   First Contact

In addition to the above, the Victoria class is well-equipped for these
secondary mission types:

-   Federation Defense

-   On-site Fleet Command Center

-   Combat Support Vehicle

Structure and Construction
==========================

One major change from most starship designs is the lack of a "neck"
connecting what would be the primary and secondary hulls. Instead, the
Victoria uses a unified, sectionless frame. This frame, composed of the
standard tritanium alloys, positions the aft portion aligned just below
center of the thicker fore portion on it's Z-Axis. This unified frame
increases the amount of useable internal space and allows the structural
integrity field to distribute stress over a stronger, more durable
design.

Six decks span the length of the ship because of this design, and the
navigational deflector and main sensor array are located at the fore.

The standard duranium/tritanium alloys compose the outer hull of the
ship as well. These alloys are layered in 5cm widths for a 6 meter total
thickness along the entire hull. A thin ablative armor finishes the
starship form for maximum protection.

The greater portion of the ship is noticeably the forward portion at
about 60% of entire length. The reason for this is to localize just
about everything on board, decreasing the amount of on ship travel time
to any location; the saucer is also about 50% thicker than the aft
portion. The aft portion localizes all of the engineering and
maintenance aspect of ship's systems.

A tried and true twin nacelle setup converts power into motion for the
Victoria class. These variable-geometry nacelles extend 30 meters from
the hull to protect the ship, and during impulse flight the nacelles
pull together and retract 10 meters closer to the ship to slightly
improve the sub-c maneuverability and decrease the overall size. During
Warp travel, the arms extend and swing back up into position. In this
manner they are like the nacelle setup on the Intrepid class.

Another notable difference from most ships is that almost every part of
the ship is tied into the main spaceframe, excluding the captain's yacht
and the bridge module, which is locate at the fore of Deck 2 instead of
the more common bulge from the top of deck 1. This better protects the
bridge from attack and makes the ship a sleeker, better spatial-dynamic
design. In order to replace a bridge, however, another module would have
to be created to the specifications, as it is not standard starship
configuration.

Science and Remote Sensing Systems
==================================

Sensor Systems
--------------

To encompass the many tasks expected from this class, a full class VIII
sensor package was installed. This package incorporates sensor arrays of
all types to allow the Victoria to perform any task needed.

Also, the ship allots 50 of it's 175 torpedo casing complement for use
as probes unless a combat situation is expected. The equipment to create
all available probes are available on board.

Computer Systems
----------------

The Starfleet budget allowed for implementation of a standard isolinear
computer core supplemented with a state of the art bio-neural system.
The ship incorporates two of the latest Starfleet Mk 10 computer cores,
located port/starboard spanning decks 3-5. As required by Starfleet,
each core is capable of running the ship should the other fail.

In addition, a bioneural processing cluster is located on deck six and
used specifically for processing central command applications during
fleet command situations. At all other times, it is used by the science
and medical labs, and is linked to the computer cores to access data.

Warp Propulsion Systems
=======================

Starfleet utilized GCI's Propulsion Division for it's power and
propulsion needs. GCI designers decided against a quad nacelle design
because the added mass would affect sublight maneuverability. They still
wanted to stay top of the line, however, so along with the starship
design they submitted two of their newly developed PN-101 Variable
Geometry Nacelles. These nacelles contain more, thinner coils than a
standard nacelle design to provide faster responses and overall better
performance in the same amount of space.

The warp power system runs off of a Starfleet standard warp core, rated
at 1548 cochranes. The ship features a cruising speed of warp 7, a
maximum sustainable speed of warp 8 and a maximum velocity of warp 9.8.

Impulse Propulsion Systems
==========================

Along with their warp drive, GCI Propulsion sent in designs for their
latest ID-6000 series Impulse Engine System. There are four such systems
on the Victoria class, two sets of two. They are located on the
port/starboard sides where the fore portion tapers into the aft portion
on Deck 7. Each set is powered by standard fusion reactors. The maximum
impulse speed available for the ship is .25c

Tactical Systems
================

Defensive Shields
-----------------

Primary defense is the standard Starfleet graviton shielding. Grids are
spread across the hull at strategic points for complete and even
coverage. The shields are capable of dissipating 4.6 x 10\^5 kW of
energy at a continuous 1680 mW graviton load.

Phaser Systems
--------------

Because of the Victoria class' physically smaller size compared to most
cruisers, and the fact that she is not intended solely for combat, R&D
chose to use several type IX arrays. The thick foreward portion sports
two dorsal and two ventral type IX arrays lining the port and starboard
sides. One dorsal type VIII stretches fore to aft along the spine from
the back of the fore portion to the aft tail in the center of the ship.
Another array stretches port-startboard on the ventral side of the aft
section. These 6 arrays allow for complete coverage with no blind spots.

Torpedo Systems
---------------

There are two torpedo systems on the Victoria class cruiser. The forward
facing Torpedo tube 1 is located on Deck 8 with feed from deck 9 on the
foremost point. Torpedo tube 2 is located on deck 8, above the shuttle
bay at the aftmost point of the ship, feeding from storage on deck 9.
With prolonged combat not being a primary mission, additional torpedo
tubes were not deemed necessary for a design this small.

Command and Support Systems
===========================

Main Bridge
-----------

The Main Bridge, unlike most starship designs, is not a standard
swappable module. Instead it is set at the fore of deck 2. Main entrance
to the bridge is provided by two turbolifts at the back, one on each
side. Between those is the entrance to the large conference room, and
the Ready Room is accessed from a door at the fore of the bridge, on the
port side. On the starboard wall just outside the turbolift is a
Jefferies Tube hatch allowing access or escape to or from the bridge to
the jefferies tube system.

Near the aft of the bridge centered between the port and starboard
sides, the Captain's chair find it's home. The Captain's seat pivots 180
degrees, giving full view of the bridge. It includes a mini-console set
in the arms allowing the CO computer access and control. Seats for the
first and second officers each are set in front of a console capable of
mimicing any other on the bridge, or a combination. The three commands
chairs are risen above the bridge on a plateau.

Stepping down, on the port side, Tactical (Tac) and Communications
(Comm) stations line the wall. The Tactical station is primarily on the
port wall, but it extends slightly into the bridge, in an L shape, to
allow the duty officer to face foreward when necessary. Comm, aft of
Tac, faces port and all consoles are on the wall. Navigation has a
standalone console on the centerline, a few feet away from the
viewscreen.

Opposite them, A longer line of stations line the wall and sweep out
into the fore of the bridge. These stations include Science,
Engineering, and Operations(Ops). This bridge setup is designed to
divide the more essential combat and fleet command stations such as
Tactical, Communications, and Navigation from the more "day to day"
stations of Science, Engineering, and Ops. It is assumed Ops and Nav are
used during any situations, and so those stations are forward and nearer
the centerline. This setup allows the Captain or Officer on Duty to
survey the entire bridge, without having to look aft for information.

The bridge is also equipped with several holoprojectors, allowing the
Emergency Medical Hologram (EMH) to perform on the bridge. In large
battle situations, the holoprojectors are capable of reproducing the
surrounding area in detail (much the same as in stellar cartography)
giving a large, detailed 3-dimensional view of the battle using
continuous sensor data. This perspective allows for better visual
coordination of fleet movement and strategy. In these situations, the
bridge, the command center of the ship, becomes an on-site fleet
coordination and command center with up-to date, accurate, and real-time
information allowing for faster planning and more strategic decision
making. This holographic display fills the open center of the bridge
behind the Navigation and Operations stations.

Officer and VIP Quarters
------------------------

Located behind the bridge and conference room are the Senior Officer's
quarters. The quarters are slightly smaller than normal, for space
conservation, but the difference is hardly noticable. Each of the
quarters still allows for a living area, a sleeping area with small bath
and restroom, and small personal office. Below, on deck 3, four VIP
quarters allow the Victoria Class to host guests and perform diplomatic
missions and diplomatic escort. Two of the four allow for custom
environments. In addition, the isolinear computer cores begin on this
deck, and span to deck 7. Four Emergency Batteries are located on the
outer edges of this deck for emergency power.

Utility Systems
===============

Cargo Bays
----------

There are two large cargo bays and eight smaller bays located on decks
10 and 11. The larger Primary cargo bays are located just behind the
large shuttle bay and are accessible from there as well through large
access doors. They are directly across from each other, and span both
decks using 26 meters of length each. Both bays have a cargo
transporter.

The eight secondary cargo bays are empty space, intended for store space
for extended missions. They are one deck thick and 13 meters in length.
Each of the four bays on deck 10 are capable of sustaining a separate
and unique environment. Two artificial graviton generators also allow
for a custom gravity strength as well. The four lower bays can be
utilized as auxiliary scientific or medical labs and locations using
"roll-away' terminals capable of complete customization and wireless
access to the computer system.

Tractor Beam Systems
--------------------

A small tractor emitter is located aft on the engineering hull above the
shuttle bay door. It is mainly used for light towing, or large object
manipulation. Access is granted through a hatch located on a walkway in
the shuttlebay.

Transporter Systems
-------------------

In addition to the cargo transporters, there are two sets of personnel
transporters. Transport Room 1 is located on deck six in the fore
portion. Transport Room 2 is located in the aft portion on the same
deck. Each transporter is an eight person capacity transporter with an
emergency mode. Emergency mode puts the transporters into a low power,
scan-only state that allows for quick beam-out. Personnel are unable to
beam up while in this mode.

Crew Support Systems
====================

Crew Quarters
-------------

Crew quarters are on decks 7 through 9 and span most of the fore section
on those decks. The quarters are smaller than standard, allowing for a
comfortable living/sleeping area and a wash/rest room. Several larger
quarters are available for families on deck 9. This configuration allows
for a crew compliment of 400 including the command staff.

Holographic Systems
-------------------

Deck four, other than the computer cores is utilized as a recreation
deck. Facilities include one holodeck, which spans up to deck 3, and
four single room Holosuites.

Recreation Systems and Four-Fore
--------------------------------

Deck four also houses an exercise and training facility and four-fore, a
small crew lounge. Four-fore contains a small bar and a food replication
system, as well as store space which can be utilized as a standard
kitchen in emergencies. Maximum capacity is 60 people.

Science Facilities
------------------

The last four decks of the ship, decks 10 through 13, are utilized for
the science and medical labs with the exception of the navigational
deflector. There is a large main Science Lab on Deck 10 as well as a
full compliment of science labs, including an extensive stellar
cartography lab as exploration is intended to be one of its primary
missions.

The lower two decks consist of a large arboretum and hydroponics area,
and related storage and auxiliary science labs.

Medical Facilites
-----------------

On deck 11, two extensive Sickbays, main and auxiliary, are located at
the fore and aft of the deck, respectively. Medical and Biological
laboratories scatter the rest of the deck including a small, basic
marine lab, anthropology, biology, and biochemistry. The wide range of
labs in both Medicine and Sciences enables the Victoria to perform
preliminary investigation and research on any situation or phenomenon
encountered.

The EMH Mk IV is equipped on the Victoria. It is limited to the bridge,
both sickbays, Main Engineering, and the holodecks. No other part of the
ship contains the necessary holoprojectors.

Auxiliary Spacecraft Systems
============================

Shuttle Bay
-----------

One large shuttle bay fills the auxiliary requirements of the ship,
located At the aftmost point of decks 9 and 10. Access to the ship
interior from the bay is gained from doors on deck 10 directly to the
flight deck, or by door leading from the control booth overlooking the
bay on deck 9 the control booth has elevator access to the bay. Shuttle
elevators allows access to a hangar which allows storage for three
shuttle sized craft, four worker craft, or a combination. In general,
one worker bee is stored in the hangar and two type nine shuttlecraft.

Captain's Yacht
---------------

As stated above, the bridge is located on Deck 2. Deck 1 is home to the
Captain's Yacht. Access to it is granted through the bridge turbolifts,
which open into an airlock that grants access to the craft. The Yacht
was built to fit flush with the hull, which means it is slightly
elongated and slightly wider than other yachts, that bulge out.

To save space and because the yacht is used for diplomatic or escape
purposes, it is also the Captain's Quarters and separated by a wall is
his bedroom and bath. The outer living area is furnished to entertain
VIP's, and includes an office desk with a customizable interface set
into a portion of it. Also included in this main room is two chairs and
a couch surrounding a low meeting table with four terminals. The fore
contains the small cockpit area, including a pilot and co-pilot seat and
all related controls and displays. The area is a step down from the rest
of the yacht, visually separating it from the room. In front of the
cockpit, a wide, picture window gives a full, undivided view of space in
front. Along with the two windows on opposite sides, this picture window
also provides a spectacular observation view of space for the captain
and visitors.

Two crewmen serve pilot duty when the yacht is deployed. Each crewmen is
expected to be able to serve as service personnel if needed when not
actively piloting. A small pilot bunk area is underneath the
living/meeting area and access is through a hatch in the cockpit.
Engineering access is gained through hatches in the cockpit for sensor,
computer, forward thruster and structural assemblies, and in the aft of
the meeting area for structural, aft thruster, microfusion generators
and drivers, and power assemblies.

Underneath the Captain's quarters and part of the main room, six
microfusion reactors provide impulse thrust and power needs for the
yacht capable of propelling the vehicle at .22c. The yacht is also
capable of landing on a planetary body, with an atmospheric cruising
speed of mach 6. Four landing feet extend so the vessel can rest.
