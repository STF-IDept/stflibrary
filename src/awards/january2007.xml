    <title>Best STFer Acceptance and Closing Speech</title>
    <para>* eagle15 goes on up.</para>
    <para>eagle15: Now, I have a speech, so I'm moderating you all again. ;)</para>
    <para>* Dipper hands over the award</para>
    <para>eagle15: Thanks, Dippy.</para>
    <para>* eagle15 hugs and kisses Dippy.</para>
    <para>eagle15: Winner's privilege, Mr. Dipper.</para>
    <para>eagle15: Well, despite all of the work, one of the good things about being the award coordinator is that I knew who won them all a week ago. :)</para>
    <para>eagle15: That means that I've had sufficient time to prepare an acceptance speech.  If you think that's unfair, you can just consider this the award closing speech. :P</para>
    <para>eagle15: I won this award last year, right before being elected President.  Whilte it meant a lot to me then, as I was shoveling through election, uh, fecal matter, it means far more now.</para>
    <para>eagle15: While I had an extremely active role in government then, it wasn't the same as being President for the past six months.  It's been a unique experience, but despite some very low points, it's been one of the best times that I've had in STF.</para>
    <para>eagle15: I can't take the credit for it, though, as my Cabinet has been wonderful and I feel like we've gotten a lot done for the club so far... and there's still more to come!</para>
    <para>eagle15: I really wanted to say something with this speech, but as I tried to write it, the words just wouldn't come to me, so I'll leave it with this.</para>
    <para>eagle15: I once thought this was cliche, but it has meant a lot to me to be given the opportunity to do some good (at least, most people say it's some good *g*) for the club.</para>
    <para>eagle15: I've put a lot of sweat and, yes, some tears into it and I thank you all for this recognition.</para>
    <para>eagle15: With this, I officially conclude the Hemenway administration's STF awards ceremony.</para>
    <para>eagle15: Thanks, guys, for really summarizing into three hours just what I feel this club means to a lot of people:</para>
    <para>eagle15: a community where we can laugh and have a heck of a lot of fun...</para>
    <para>eagle15: but take forever doing it. :)</para>
