Proposal
========

Background
----------

Earlier this morning, I was approached by an individual with an
interesting idea to open the IRC channel to an actual sim. While a good
idea in theory, it could be refined to suit our needs.

Problem
-------

As we all know, currently, all that happens in the channel is we talk
for a little while, then the channel lays dormant for a few hours. This
would ensure as little idle time as possible in the channel.

Proposal
--------

I propose a normal type IRC sim at a set time and day of the week, with
a GM, CO, etc. The GM would have complete control of the sim, the PM
function could be used to simulate communications. The channel Ops would
be in charge of maintaining our PG-13 rating. We could continue to write
our responses in third person, past tense, and use the /me commands to
show action. If there is enough interest, then we shouldn't have any
problems crewing the ship. Of course, this would be on a trial basis,
perhaps as little as 30 days. Any other time that the room has an OP, it
can be used as a free sim on the same ship.

Discussion
----------

I realize that this would take a lot of planning on everyone's part,
but, I believe that as a club, it's possible for us to do this. If
anyone sees a problem with this (I'm talking to the long timers that can
actually remember when this was the norm), please respond. I'm keenly
interested in hearing everyone's thoughts on this!

Minutes
=======

1. Dominic Waite
:   Interested in trying an IRC sim. Quiet \#star-fleet times are when
    people are not around or busy. This is perhaps not a good time to
    try an IRC sim. It is suggested that we create a separate IRC
    channel.

2. Matt Bernardin
:   Not interested in an IRC Sim. The IRC channel is intended to provide
    a universal couch/hammock/futon for members and prospective members
    to come, talk and share. Club should look at interested numbers.

3. Ed Amoroso
:   Is there enough interest for this to be successful? Members of a BBS
    RPG site may find IRC sims not to their tastes. The sims would have
    to set up during peak IRC times. However, this could cut into peak
    IRC chatting times on \#star-fleet. If we created a new channel, it
    wouldn't interrupt people who are on IRC simply to chat.

4. Larry Garfield
:   \#star-fleet being a hang out venue not a bad thing. IRC Sim should
    be in another channel, not \#star-fleet. \#Star-fleet should remain
    an OOC chat area. As mentioned in item 2, is there enough interest
    to make it worthwhile? Do we have any GMs who are competent to run
    an IRC mission (which is different from a regular BBS sim. There are
    other clubs who specialize in IRC RPing. Do we want to consider a
    "cross sponsoring" setup with an IRC RPG club?

5. Chris Jones
:   In response to item 2, in order to set up an IRC ship, a test run
    would have to be conducted and a new IRC channel be formed. In
    response to 4, didn't mean to suggest \#star-fleet being a hang
    venue was bad, simply that it would be fun to have an IRC sim
    because the interest is there from people asking about it in the
    channel.

6. Ed Amoroso
:   Some recruiting would have to be done to find a suitable XO, CO, GM,
    and DHs who are qualified to do IRC RPGing. How would the current
    STF rules fit with the IRC sims? ie GM training and selection. In
    response to item 4, a club partnership with another club would allow
    members of our club the opportunity to IRC RP in an environment that
    STF has identified as good.

7. Jessica McClary
:   The time it takes to complete an IRC Sim should be considered. Some
    members can dedicate many hours while other cannot. Would IRC Sims
    be broken down into stages?

8. Chris Jones
:   In response to item 7, it could be possible to do a 2 hour sim with
    a break in the middle or broken down into episodes if planned
    correctly. Is that too long or two short?

9. Larry Garfield
:   In response to item 8, regular STF Sims always last longer than you
    planned. The club as a whole doesn't really have the mechanics of
    IRC role playing. “Outsourcing the idea would be the better way to
    go and would save the club the large learning curve.”

10. Matt Bernardin
:   Agrees with Item 9. Who will be able to role play in the IRC Sims?
    Can anyone or just the registered members of STF's?

11. Andrew Robinson
:   Has experience with IRCSims. Agrees that we'd have to set up a
    seperate channel as \#star-fleet definately wouldn't work. Agrees
    that we'd also need a very experienced GM with IRCSim and RTRP (Real
    Time Role Play) Sim history to handle the ship. Agrees that we'd
    need at least a few experienced IRC or RTRP players to act as senior
    officers. A set of rules posted and explanations governing the
    differing aspects of an IRCSim would need to be made.

    Sim length would definitely be more than one or two hours long. RTRP
    Sim's, unless they are freeform, rely heavily on a forum/message
    board/group to keep track of what has happened and list the
    background information on a Sim. The GM or a named log keeper would
    need to maintain a synopsis of current events and past events in the
    sim, as well as a complete log should someone need to see what has
    happened.

    It's not necessary for everyone involved to be online at any given
    time, and the only person who does have to be online to keep the sim
    moving is the GM. Other than this, it can be handled in snippets,
    with any thread being carried on provided that all those players
    involved are online at the same time.

    It's impractical for any sim to last only a few hours, because it's
    unrealistic to \*ever\* expect all 15 people to be online at any one
    given time, and it's a logistical nightmare to try and organize
    anything around time zones and work schedules, a nightmare which
    gets progressively larger the more people you involve.

    The only time you would need at least two thirds of the crew online
    would be the start of a sim, something which need only last an hour
    or so.

    So we have the beginning of a sim with 2/3 of the crew, at least all
    the senior officers. Once that is complete and a log is posted on
    the board/group/forum, with Sim background and some useful
    information, it can all be taken from there, with threads picking up
    wherever people are online with the GM.

    If it can work and the interest is there, then once we've got an
    appropriate GM, it could be brilliant, but also bear in mind that
    95% of all IRC/RTRP Sim's fail because people can't put in the time,
    or aren't versatile enough to manage it.

12. Amanda Noon
:   Why do people want to real time role play? Is it because they want
    to sim, or because they want to role play their characters in real
    time?

13. Chris Jones
:   In response to item 12, the idea was brought up just to try
    something new. People in \#star-fleet had mentioned that they wanted
    to try.

14. David Wonderly
:   Even if we get everything mentioned above, there is still the
    problem a crew. STF has people from all over the world and real life
    role playing would take away from that.

15. Jen Herr
:   Real life role playing works differently than what we're used to,
    but I think that pushing our knowledge and abilities would help us
    grow. The sim would last only 2 hours, and would be similar to a
    star trek episode like Chris was saying... sometimes Star Trek
    episodes are to be continued. There might not be a beginning to end
    sim in those 2 hours, but progress would be made on a continuing
    sim.

    In response to ietm 11, Though I have no doubt this way of siming
    might work for some people, this is not what I have experienced, and
    is not what I imagine when thinking of an IRC sim. I did describe my
    experience and what I imagine for this club in an earlier post
    though. ;)

    Smaller crew, focused sim (one timeline, two max, not multiple
    threads), time limit. It worked in my experience.

    One objection to this format might be: What if there are more than 7
    people interested? If we decide to do this, and are successful with
    a trial sim, and more people want to participate, we simply open up
    more sim times and sim opportunities.

    In response to item 12, we should have a sim channel open all the
    times during non-sim times. New characters should be made for the
    IRC sim ship.
