Proposal
========

Problem
-------

Our member count is consitantly declining, as has been shown in the
PDept reports and monthly Census. The reasons for this are most likely
varied, but it is clear that it is something we need to address and stop
if we want to continue supporting the amount of ships we currently have.
Given the most recent reaction to the Paladin's decomission, I suspect
most people would agree with me on the above.

### History

As you can see in the Command Log, we discussed the prospect of having
diplomatic relations with another club, the AQSG, earlier this term. It
was generally decided that we weren't ready to jump into a formal
agreement with them yet, but that we'd like to try a banner exchange
first.

Well, the banner exchange was tried. Discussions were discussed, and in
the end, they're holding up their end of the bargin and being cool
people.

My conclusion is that this trial period is passed with a success.

Proposal
--------

The proposal is rather simple, and all the work is done: Formalize our
relationship with the AQSG in an alliance. The paperwork is written, the
name of the alliance chosen, all we need is a general consensus from the
club.

An Executive Assistant position would be created, titled Star Fleet
Diplomat, who would be charged with maintaining this relationship.

Discussion
----------

There are many things we need to do to address our membership problems,
and I believe this is a solid first step in doing so. Primarily, we need
to establish ourselves in the internet gaming community by advertising
and joining with other reputable groups to promote the activity. This is
the first step in doing that. We become founders of something that could
become very large and prosperous (in terms of membership), while paying
for it with nothing but our support. If at any time we wish to withdraw,
we can simply by saying so.

In terms of a cost/benefit analysis, our cost is the time we invest on
the alliance. Thus far, the time investment has been minimal, and I do
not forsee that escilating very much if at all. What do we gain? Most
obviously, we gain an ally. Two heads are better than one... the AQSG
has a unique perspective, but is a group that is very similar to our
own. The Alliance would afford them absolutely NO governmental or
political rights in our club... infact they don't even get member
accounts unless they join like any other member. What we gain is
friendship and an opportunity to expand our name in the internet RPG
world, and thus hopefully bring in some new members.

In the future, this could expand to joint projects and ventures, but for
now, we're just looking to formalize a friendship. We'd like to move up
the next step of testing the waters with this group, and I believe we
could only benefit from it.
