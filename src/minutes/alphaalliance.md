Proposal
========

Background
----------

AQSG approached me with this idea. I spoke with Ryan through email
first, and he told me a lot about his club. Then we got together on IM
and discussed this idea, and more about our clubs. Though the two clubs
have their differences, I believe we share a similar approach to Star
Trek role playing.

While looking through their site, I was impressed with how good it
looked. It is well maintained and easy to navigate, which means to me
that they care about their club and take pride in their role playing.

Problem
-------

-   Our membership numbers have decreased over the past few years.
    Though the cause is hard to determine, it is clear that we need to
    advertise and bring in more members if we want to keep our current
    number of role playing environments.

-   STF is very good at what it does (bulletin board RPGs), but we have
    no experience in offering other types of role playing environments.
    Through previous discussion, it was decided that being able to offer
    such environments would boost our club's value, but we would rather
    partner with a club that specializes in other environments than
    start up new ones ourselves.

Proposal
--------

The leader of another role playing club emailed me about two weeks ago
with an interesting proposal that I would like us to seriously consider.
I will address his club more specifically in the Discussion section.

The proposal is to form an alliance of some sort between our two groups.
We would call it something like "Starfleet Alliance" or "Star Trek
Simming Alliance". Both groups would be members of this Alliance. Each
group remains completely individual within themselves... that is, we
both retain our identies, our governments, our way of doing things...
the only thing that changes is that we're forming an Alliance with this
other group, which includes a governing body of its own.

The suggestion for this governing body was that each group sends a
certain number of reps that would form a council or senate, and they
would basically oversee this Alliance. Any decisions that the council
wants to make would fall to the leaderships of the individual groups to
be voted on or decided on with whatever process we decide. Anything that
affects the Alliance would need to pass all three bodies to be approved.
Either group could propose something to the Alliance as well, and the
process would be the same, requiring all three bodies to agree before it
passes.

Discussion
----------

There are obviously many things to consider about this proposal. Why is
it necessary? What are the benefits? What are the drawbacks? What about
this group?

-   I believe this would address the problems listed in the Problem
    section. The club is mostly Play by Email. It is well established
    (started in the mid 90s) with 200-300 members. They operate on a
    similar fleet system that we do, though their government operates
    differently. However, with an Alliance with this group, I believe we
    only stand to gain members, while being able to offer a service that
    many of our members may appreciate.

-   Aside from the member benefits, and the benefits we gain by being
    able to be more flexible and offer more services to our members, I
    believe the idea itself offers potential benefits. If the Alliance
    works out, we could look to expand it and include other types of
    role playing groups. Such expansion would again help advertise us
    and bring in new members from different types of role playing
    systems.

    We could discuss sharing resources between our two groups, which has
    the potential to create stronger resources with a larger membership
    pool helping out to maintain and create them.

    Since we would be a founding member of the Alliance, we would have a
    large say in how it is moulded and developed. We help shape it to be
    what we want it to be, instead of just joining another Alliance for
    these same benefits.

-   A potential drawback I see is that this Alliance might become too
    political. The LAST thing I want to do is create more political red
    tape for this club. I think that if we keep this in mind though, we
    can avoid this in the founding of the Alliance.

-   The group itself is here: http://www.aqsg.org/index.html

I am not advertising for them, but I'm showing you who is interested in
partnering with us. They pride themselves on strong role playing, and
seem to be a straight forward group from what I can tell. They have
seven fleets which include star bases and ships, and a budding Star gate
sim. Their government is composed of the seven fleet commanders, which I
think is lead by the three senior most. Their political process is far
less complicated than ours though, and I believe COs have the majority
of the legislative rights over their ships.

I've spoken with their leader for a few hours, and he would be happy to
answer any questions we might have about this idea, or his club. If
anyone would like to speak with him directly let me know and I'll set
you in contact.

I know there are probably 1000 things that I haven't thought of in
regards to this idea, so please, discuss away! I look forward to hearing
the thoughts of the club.

Minutes
=======

1. Ryan Harper
:   Introduced himself as part of the Alpha Quadrant Sim Group. He
    discussed his views on the possible problems (mentioned in Jens
    post) which could arise and volunteered himself to answer any
    questions members had. He later replied to the idea of a banner
    exchange by commenting on his clubs past experiences with Banner
    exchanges that haven't worked out. He expressed that there are many
    different views of ' Alliance' and it would be an agreement both
    clubs decided the terms on however banner exchange and sister clubs
    were a little too informal. He again responded to elaborate on what
    the alliance would entail as he saw it and explained how each club
    in-fact would remain separate but unified at the same time.

2. Larry Garfield
:   His initial reaction was; "a governmental alliance with another
    organization is premature." And suggested that rather than beginning
    with an Alliance to start with a banner exchange. Said that it was
    better to get to know each other first before committing to
    anything. Also asked what sort of proposals? What sorts of things
    would require this "Trek Club UN"?

3. John Robert Lucas
:   Agreed with Larry's banner exchange idea and suggested re-visiting
    the alliance a few months later after seeing how the exchange went.
    He pointed out in a later post that the Alliance seemed premature
    and emphasised once again that the exchange idea was better.

4. Jack Dipper
:   Again agreed with Larry and suggested that the two clubs should work
    up a relationship before agreeing to merge/share resources on a
    trial basis of a couple of months then goes on from there.

5. Jen Herr
:   Pointed out that what Jack suggested first was in-fact what was the
    intended course of action however in a more organised manner.

6. Jack Dipper
:   Acknowledged Jen's response.

7. John Robert Lucas
:   Agrees with Jack.

8./9./10./11. Ryan Harper
:   Responds to Larry's and Jack's concerns, saying there are different
    types of alliances.

12. Jen Herr
:   Provides some tips about posting.

13. Colin Wyers
:   Posted a few questions on the Alliance idea in order to clarify
    certain points before he offered any other opinions.

14. Geoff Joosten
:   Expresses concern about an alliance becoming political.

15. Jen Herr
:   Responds to Colin that AQSG approached her with the idea of an
    alliance.

16. Brandon Irvine
:   Interested in what the other club has to offer.

17./18./19. Larry Garfield
:   Expresses a desire to move slowly and provides more posting tips.
    Requests what problem we're trying to solve.

20. Amanda Noon
:   “"I thought we had agreed to try a banner exchange with other clubs
    first. Wasn't that why we developed a new Logo?"”

21. Catherine Potterton
:   Expresses concern about sharing resources and member ranks.

22. Jack Dipper
:   Elaborates on Cat's questions about the mechanics of the alliance
    and why we're entering into it.

23. John Robert Lucas
:   Agrees with Jack.

24. Jen Herr
:   Alliance, proposed final comments
