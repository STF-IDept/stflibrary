  <section>
    <title>Supersession of Previous Edicts</title>
    <para>Edicts Cramer #4 and Robinson #33 are hereby rescinded and superseded by this edict.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Establishment</title>
    <para>A Bills and Bylaws system is hereby established as a primary tool of clubwide governance. The Bills and Bylaws system is designed to streamline ammendments to pillar edicts as well as ensure that those ammendments made are undertaken with the best interests of the club membership in mind</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Bylaws</title>
    <para>A Bylaw is defined as any edict which establishes clubwide policy or governs administrative features of the club. The litmus test for determining what constitutes a Bylaw is to decide whether or not it has a profound and long term impact upon the club or its administration.</para>
    <para>Bylaws shall be maintained by the STF Librarian.</para>
    <para>The Librarian may make non-substantive changes to a Bylaw dealing with spelling, grammar and format which do not impact the meaning, interpretation or spirit of the bylaw. No substantive changes may be made to a Bylaw without the issuance of a Bill by the sitting President or acting President.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Bills</title>
    <para>A Bill is an ammendment to any Bylaw or the implementation of a new Bylaw.</para>
    <para>Any change determined necessary to a Bylaw must be issued by the sitting President or acting President as a Bill. This will be presented as a section/paragraph reference and the proposed ammendment to that section. Any Bill must first be presented as a proposition to the Membership within Command for discussion. When a Bill is readied for issuance, it must be posted within the STF Command Ship under the topic "Office Of The President". Each bill must contain the Bill number, issuing authorities name, the date of issuance and their capacity as either President or acting President.</para>
    <para>Once a Bill is issued, the Librarian is required to make the ammendments to the Bylaw within the Library. The Bill will be archived in its issued format for reference.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Edicts</title>
  <para>An Edict is a presidential tool for managing the club in its day to day operation and includes any action not defined as either a Bill or a Bylaw.</para>
  <para>In order for an Edict to be legal, it must be posted within the STF Command Ship under the topic "Office Of The President". Each Edict must contain the Edict number, issuing authorities name, the date of issuance and their capacity as either President or Acting President.</para>
  <para>Edicts may not include more than a single topic base. For example, multiple promotions may be issued within a single edict, but promotions and establishments of new role play areas may not be included within a single edict. Multiple disciplinary actions may be issued within a single edict, but not disciplinary actions and promotions.</para>
