    <title>Supercedence of previous edicts</title>
    <para>Edict Hemenway #10 is hereby rescinded and superceded by this Edict.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Fleet structure and command</title>
    <section>
      <title>Definition</title>
      <para>A Fleet is a collection of one or more Role-Playing Ships under the command of a Fleet Commander independent from other Fleets. A Fleet may include non-RPG ships in addition to Role-Playing ships.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Creation and Decommissioning</title>
      <para>A Fleet may be created by Presidential Edict. A Fleet must be filled with at least one Standard Ship and have a Fleet Commander appointed promptly. A Fleet may be decommissioned by Presidential Edict provided any ships within the Fleet are simultaneously decommissioned or moved to other Fleets. If a Fleet is decommissioned, the related Fleet Commander and Assistant Fleet Commander positions are eliminated.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Fleet Commander</title>
      <para>All Fleets are commanded by a Fleet Commander, appointed by the President. The Fleet Commander is considered a member of the Cabinet. The Fleet Commander is charged with seeing to the proper functioning of the Fleet under his command and the administration of related COs, XOs, and other Ship Administrators. The Fleet Commander is responsible for the outward image of the Fleet under his command, for reporting to the President and working with the President on matters of Fleet business, and other duties as specified in this and other Edicts.</para>
      <para>Specifically, the Fleet Commander is responsible for ensuring that the Ships under his command are healthy and properly functioning role playing environments, that the internal and external pages under his jurisdiction are maintained, and that fleet reports which detail the current status of each ship under his or her command are submitted to the President. The President is responsible for dictating in policy how and when fleet reports should be submitted.</para>
      <para>In the event that the positions of CO and XO on a ship both become vacant simultaneously, due to AWOL, eLOA, resignation, or other circumstances, the Fleet Commander may appoint an aCO and aXO. They must notify the President of such action and relay their recommendation on whether replacing the CO permanently is necessary or not.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Assistant Fleet Commander</title>
      <para>Each Fleet Commander is required to appoint a single Assistant Fleet Commander. The Assistant Fleet Commander's primary responsibility is to take over as acting Fleet Commander should the Fleet Commander declare a LOA. An Assistant Fleet Commander may declare the Fleet Commander AWOL with the consent of the President and assume the position of acting Fleet Commander until such time as the President appoints a new Fleet Commander. Additional duties may be assigned to the Assistant Fleet Commander at the discretion of the Fleet Commander. The Assistant Fleet Commander is considered a member of Command, but is not a member of the Cabinet.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Restrictions</title>
      <para>The Fleet Commander must be a current or former CO of the fleet in question, or a current or former XO in the fleet in question with CO experience. The Assistant Fleet Commander must be a current or former CO or XO of the fleet in question. Equivalent positions in an Alternate RPG Area may count equivalently. Acting CO or XO does not count.No individual may be the Fleet Commander or Assistant Fleet Commander of more than one Fleet at a time, nor may any individual be Fleet Commander of one Fleet and Assistant Fleet Commander of another Fleet at the same time. The President may not be the Fleet Commander or Assistant Fleet Commander of any Fleet. Acting holder of a position does not count towards these restrictions.</para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Ships</title>
    <section>
      <title>Standard Ships</title>
      <para>A Standard Ship is any self-contained RPG Starship or Starbase, commanded by a CO, on which regular RPGs take place under the administration of the GameMaster Department and the Fleet Commander. All Standard Ships must reside in a Fleet and be a Starfleet vessel or starbase. Additionally, all Standard Ships are set approximately 376 years after the current modern year. That is, the year 2000 real time corresponds to the year 2376 In Character time, and one-year real time corresponds to approximately one year RPG time.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>OOC Ships</title>
      <para>An OOC Ship is a starship, starbase, or other similar division that is present in a Fleet or an Executive Department but not staffed by a crew or the site of an actual RPG. OOC Ships are intended for Out of Character interaction between STF members. OOC Ships are established managed at the discretion of the Fleet Commander or Department Director.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Non-Crewed Ships</title>
      <para>A Non-Crewed Ship is a Starship or Starbase that is considered part of a Fleet for RPG purposes but is not actively commissioned nor staffed by Player Characters. Non-Crewed ships assigned to a Fleet are available for use by GMs for RPG purposes, and if destroyed are recycled.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Alternative RPG Areas</title>
      <section>
        <title>Definition</title>
        <para>Alternate RPG Areas are those areas where RPGs take place that do not meet one or more of the characteristics for Standard Ships. The President may establish by edict a charter for an Alternative RPG Area within a given Fleet, with the consent of the applicable Fleet Commander. If nothing is specified for a given parameter of the RPG environment, it is assumed to be the same as a Standard RPG Area. For example, if no time frame is specified, the Alternate RPG Area is assumed to operate in the same time as Standard RPG Areas.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Leadership</title>
        <para>Alternative RPG Areas will have a Leader or Administrator who is responsible for seeing to the well being of the Area. Their specific functions, including their specific title, will be specified by the chartering Edict if they differ from those of a standard ship. The Alternative RPG Area charter must also specify whether the Leader or Administrator position counts as an XO or CO position for purposes of XO and CO restrictions, and any special rules or circumstances regarding the naming of the Leader or Administrator. If not specified, the Leader or Administrator is called the Commanding Officer (CO), is appointed by the President in the same fashion as a Standard Ship CO, and will count towards a CO position as on a Standard Ship.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Charter</title>
        <para>In addition to the above requirements, the Alternative RPG Area charter must also specify whether or not RPG ranks in the Area count towards a member's Member Rank or not and whether the environment is a Second Character Only environment or not. The Personnel Department may only assign new members to an Alt RPG if the new member specifically requests that assignment and the ship is chartered or marked as able to accept new members who request such an assignment. The charter must also include minimum standards that the RPG must maintain in order to remain a commissioned environment. The Alternative RPG Area's charter may only be amended by Presidential Edict, with the consent of the related Fleet Commander and Area Leader or Administrator.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Ship management</title>
    <section>
      <title>Commissioning and Maintenance of Standard Ships</title>
      <para>All Standard Ships in a Fleet are commissioned by Presidential Edict, with the prior consent the Fleet Commander. The Fleet Commander must choose a ship name and a class approved by the Engineering Department for that purpose prior to commissioning. Starbases must have Engineering Department approved specs prior to commissioning as well. If the ship class as approved by the Engineering Department includes a list of ship names, the name must come from that list, with changes to that list governed by Engineering Department policy. No two ships in STF may be of the same name simultaneously.</para>
      <para>All Standard Ships are required to maintain the following criteria:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>They must maintain an enjoyable environment that is beneficial for both the ship and the club as a whole.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>They must maintain a crew of reliable players, with the majority within the ship-specific AWOL guidelines.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>They must maintain, within reason, a full command and senior staff, defined as a Commanding Officer, an Executive Officer, a Gamemaster, a Chief Engineer, a Chief Medical Officer, a Chief Science Officer, and a Chief of Security. Any command-level vacancy must be filled within 14 days of its occurrence.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>They must manage to function as a Standard Ship successfully, with due regard to the current time period and technology level.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>Should a Standard Ship deviate from these criteria, it will be subject to decommissioning per the terms of this Edict.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Decommissioning</title>
      <para>Decommissioning a Role-Playing Area shall be considered the last resort when dealing with an environment that no longer meets the required critera. Before decommissioning an Area, reasonable effort by the Fleet Commander and by the Area Commanding Officer must be made to restore the environment. This may include (but is not required to, nor limited to) public discussion, advertisement in the Personnel Department, or replacement of the Area's Commanding Officer.</para>
      <para>Standard Ships and Alternate RPG Areas may be decommissioned by Presidential Edict. If a ship is decommissioned, all positions relating to that Ship are eliminated. For a Standard Ship, the appropriate Fleet Commander will work with the Personnel Department in order to place remaining crewmembers in positions equal or greater than held on the decommissioned ship, should they desire it. The Internet Department will be responsible for the archival and removal of any resources relating to the decommissioned ship.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Relocation</title>
      <para>Any Role Playing Area may be moved from one Fleet to another by Presidential Edict with the consent of the related Fleet Commanders. The Commanding Officer may be consulted about the relocation and must be informed in a reasonable amount of time about the impending relocation.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Rechristening</title>
      <para>A Standard Ship in service in a Fleet may be rechristened to a new name and/or class by Presidential Edict with the consent of the Fleet Commander and the ship's CO. A ship may be destroyed and automatically replaced with a new vessel of the same name and class with prior consent of the Fleet Commander and CO. Both events may occur simultaneously with the approval of all those listed above and under the condition that the new name must be chosen from the name list of the new class. Should a ship be rechristened with the same name as it held previously, either due to a change of class or destruction, it shall incur a one-letter suffix increment.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Commanding Officer (CO)</title>
      <para>The CO of a RPG Ship serves as the ship's Administrator and In-Character commanding officer. A CO is appointed by Presidential Edict, with the advice and consent of the Fleet Commander. A CO may be removed by the Fleet Commander with the consent of the President. The removal is then made official by the Presidential Edict that replaces the CO.</para>
      <section>
        <title>Responsibilities</title>
        <para>In addition to acting as the In Character Commanding Officer, the CO is responsible for ensuring that the crew stays active; managing personnel, recruiting personnel, and enforcing AWOL policies on the ship; ensuring that new members are given adequate assistance as needed; maintaining the ship's MOTD; optionally maintaining a Ship or Captain's Log; submitting reports to the Fleet Commander as mandated; and further duties as assigned by the Fleet Commander or established by Edict. The CO is responsible for ensuring the completion of his or her duties, even if they are delegated to someone else.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Powers</title>
        <para>The CO has the power to promote members of his or her crew up to and including the rank of Lieutenant Commander. The CO may promote members of his or her crew to the rank of Commander with the consent of the Fleet Commander.</para>
        <para>The CO may establish and staff additional 'Swing' positions on a ship as deemed appropriate, in keeping with the design of the class of the ship in question.</para>
        <para>The CO also has the power to dismiss members of their crews if they determine that such action is necessary to preserve or restore the ability of the ship to function effectively. A member dismissed from a ship may appeal the decision to the FComm (or AFComm if the CO in question is FComm). The ruling of the FComm (or AFComm) in this matter is final and may not be appealed further. Other powers may be specified by Edict or by the Fleet Commander.</para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Restrictions</title>
        <para>No individual may hold more than one CO position simultaneously. Acting CO does not count towards this limit.</para>
        <para>Second Player Characters are restricted to JOs and below. That means that no player may hold two DH positions on a single ship at once, or a Command position and a DH position on a single ship at once. Acting DH, Acting XO and Acting CO do not apply to these restrictions.</para>
        <para>COs are encouraged to use strict discretion when allowing non-canon positions, character types, and second player characters so that their ship maintains a healthy, fun, and canon-compatible role playing environment.</para>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Executive Officer (XO)</title>
      <para>In addition to RPG duties, the XO is responsible for assisting other members of the ship as needed. The CO may enlist the aid of his XO in fulfilling his or her ship management duties, but the CO will remain ultimately responsible for them. The XO's primary responsibility is to take over as acting CO (aCO) should the CO declare an LOA. An XO may declare the CO AWOL with the consent of the Fleet Commander and assume the position of acting CO until such time as the President appoints a new CO. A CO may appoint his or her own XO with the consent of the Fleet Commander, should the Fleet Commander choose to exercise such authority.</para>
      <para>No individual may hold more than one XO position simultaneously. Acting XO does not count towards this limit. When choosing an XO, preference should be given to members who do not currently have a CO position if possible.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Character Restrictions</title>
      <para>Every Non-Civilian Player Character must have an adequate and believable reason for joining Starfleet that does not violate canon. Civilian characters must have an adequate and believable reason for being permitted to serve on a Starfleet vessel or base. Player Characters on Alternate RPGs may violate these rules only if such violations are specified and explained in the Alternate RPG charter.</para>
      <para>Player Characters shall follow these guidelines:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Canon Federation member species are acceptable. Examples of Canon Federation member species include Humans, Vulcans, Trill, Andorians, and Betazoids.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Canon Allied species are discouraged, and permitted only in special circumstances with the prior consent of the CO. Examples of Canon Allied species include Klingons.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Canon Neutral or Hostile species are forbidden. Examples of Canon Neutral or Hostile species include Romulans, Ferengi, Cardassians, Borg, and Breen.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Custom Federation member species are discouraged, and permitted only in special circumstances with the prior consent of the CO. The character and species must have an adequate and believable back-story that explains why the character is in Starfleet and why the species is a Federation member or ally. If the custom character species is created by someone other than the player, the player must have the creator's permission to play that character species. If the creator cannot be reached, the species may only be played if the information given about it is publically accessible and not restricted.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Custom allied, neutral, or hostile species are forbidden.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>"God moding" or "super" characters are strictly forbidden. Examples of "God-moding" or "Super" characters include Borg, Species 8472, Q, and Changelings.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Mixed-species characters must be a believable mix, and of no more than three (3) species.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>The decision regarding any character type rests with the Commanding Officer of the ship where the character will be played. Any dispute between a player and a CO will be moderated and decided upon by the appropriate Fleet Commander. In the event that the CO is also the Fleet Commander, the dispute will be moderated by the Assistant Fleet Commander. The decision by the Fleet Commander or Assistant Fleet Commander shall be considered final.</para>
      <para>In the special circumstance where it is felt a player can adequately and believably play a forbidden character species, the player may do so with the consent of the Commanding Officer and the related Fleet Commander. In the event that the CO is also the Fleet Commander, the approval of the Assistant Fleet Commander is required. This consent may be removed if the player does not maintain the adequate and believable requirement. In both cases, any decision made is final and not appealable.</para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Implementation</title>
    <para>All current Player Characters are exempt from the Character Restrictions set forth in this Edict. If a player discontinues playing an exempt Player Character for any reason, the Player Character's exempt status is forfeited and the player must either choose a valid character species or seek approval through the requirements listed before resuming the Character.</para>
