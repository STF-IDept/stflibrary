There shall be three general types of governmental appointment made by
the President of STF.

Fleet Command
:   The Fleet Commander of each Fleet shall be appointed by the
    President, who shall name his own Assistant Fleet Commander. The
    Fleet Commander is considered a member of the cabinet. Further
    details of Fleet Command can be found elsewhere in other edicts.

Executive Departments
:   An Executive Department is a governmental department responsible for
    overseeing some aspect of STF's administration. A Department may set
    internal policy as well as general policy for those matters relating
    to its sphere of influence, with the consultation of the President.
    An Executive Department is headed by a Departmental Director,
    appointed by the President, who shall name his own Assistant
    Director and, if needed, any other internal departmental positions.
    The Departmental Director is considered a member of the cabinet.
    Further details of Departmental activity can be found elsewhere in
    other edicts.

Executive Assistants
:   An Executive Assistant is a governmental "at large" officer
    responsible for some stated activity as defined by Edict. An
    Executive Assistant may set internal policy relating to his
    responsibilities, but is not empowered to set policy for the club at
    large. An Executive Assistant is appointed by the President, but is
    not required to appoint an assistant unless explicitly stated by
    Edict and is not considered a member of the cabinet.

As of the date of this edict, the following Executive Departments exist:
Personnel Department, Internet Department, Engineering Department,
Gamemaster Department, and Starfleet Academy.
