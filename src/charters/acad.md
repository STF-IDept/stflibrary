Supercedence of previous edicts
===============================

Herr \#32 is hereby rescinded and superceded by this edict.

Establishment of the Academy Department
=======================================

An Executive Department is hereby established under the name "Starfleet
Academy".

Starfleet Academy shall serve as a resource to the membership on matters
relating to ongoing training and development in STF.

The daily activity of Starfleet Academy shall be overseen by the Academy
Commandant, who shall be appointed by the President. The Academy
Commandant is a cabinet position, and is equal in power to other
departmental directors and Fleet Commanders.

The Vice Commandant shall be appointed by the Academy Commandant. The
Vice Commandant answers directly to the Academy Commandant, and is
responsible for departmental decisions in the event the Academy
Commandant is not available. Additional responsibilities are at the
discretion of the Academy Commandant.

The Academy Commandant and the Vice Commandant must have had three
months Academy experience (excluding time served as a cadet), preferably
as a Commanding Officer or Executive Officer on an Academy Ship.

The Academy Commandant may delegate any of his duties enumerated in this
Edict, or any other responsibilities incumbent upon him as a result of
another Edict, to another named staff member of Starfleet Academy.

Establishment of Academy Courses
================================

The Academy shall maintain a set of courses, which must at least include
a course for Engineering, Gamemaster (in coordination with the
Gamemaster Department), Medical, Science, and Security. Additional
courses are at the discretion of the Academy Commandant. These courses
are taken on a voluntary basis. Should a member pass one of the courses,
greater consideration for a Department Head position should be granted.
Passing one of the courses does not guarantee a promotion.

Establishment of the Academy Fleet
==================================

A new fleet is hereby established within Starfleet Academy. The Fleet
will house all Academy Training Ships as well as the Academy
administrative areas. The Academy Commandant and Vice Commandant will
have the same powers as Fleet Commander and Assistant Fleet Commander
respectively, unless otherwise defined by this edict.

The Academy Commandant is responsible for setting an AWOL/LOA policy in
an Academy Mandate. This policy should be maintained on an Academy page,
and linked from the main Academy MOTD and the Academy ships' MOTDs.

Academy Fleet Command Structure
===============================

Commanding Officer (CO)
:   The CO is appointed by the President of STF, with the advice and
    consent of the Academy Commandant. The CO will have the powers and
    responsibilities of a mainstream CO, except that he cannot promote
    members of his crew. The character rank of the CO must be Captain.
    Academy COs must have held the position of CO on a mainstream ship
    for a minimum of three months, and Academy experience is preferable.

Executive Officer (XO)
:   The XO is appointed by the CO, with the advice and consent of the
    Academy Commandant. The XO will have the powers and responsibilities
    of a mainstream XO. The character rank of the XO must be Commander.
    Academy XOs must have held the position of XO on a mainstream ship
    for a minimum of three months, and Academy experience is preferable.

Counselor (CNS)
:   The CNS is appointed by the CO, with the advice and consent of the
    Academy Commandant. The CNS will not have any administrative tasks,
    but will be required to assist Cadets with posting. The character
    rank of the CNS must be Lieutenant Commander. Academy CNS must have
    held the position of DH on either on a mainstream ship or an Academy
    ship for a minimum of three months.

Gamemaster (GM)
:   The GM is appointed by the CO, with the advice and consent of the
    Academy Commandant. The Gamemaster of an Academy ship must be an
    experienced GM holding the classification of Full Gamemaster. If a
    Full Gamemaster, or higher, cannot be found, a Junior Gamemaster may
    be considered. Gamemaster Trainees may not be considered, under any
    circumstance. Should the GM be removed mid-mission, the mission is
    to be continued by the Command Staff, without interruption, and a
    replacement Gamemaster is to be found within two weeks.

:   Each standard department (Engineering, Medical, Science and
    Security) has one department head. A DH position may be filled in
    one of two ways, at the discretion of the CO, notifying the Academy
    Commandant.

:   Each standard department (Engineering, Medical, Science and
    Security) can hold a maximum of three Cadets. Cadets who serve on
    the Academy ships shall hold the member rank of Cadet and are not
    eligible for rank promotion while they take part in their training.
    Due to the high demand for Academy spots, Cadets on the training
    vessels (who have not graduated, or are not in the process of
    graduating) can only be transferred or offered a position on another
    ship with the consent of the Academy Commandant.

With the exception of Cadet, all Academy ranks do not affect the
player's member rank.

Joining the Academy Fleet
=========================

New members may request to join an Academy Training Ships when joining
STF. The Personnel Department is required to honour department and
posting speed choices, if possible, and allocate them evenly throughout
the fleet. If the department and posting speed choices cannot be
honoured, the new member will be placed on a mainstream ship. The
Academy Commandant is to be informed if a member was unable to be
placed.

Current members on mainstream ships may also request to join the
Academy. In this case, admission is dependent on the judgment of the
member's Commanding Officers and Academy Commandant. They are to assess
whether the member is struggling and whether he would benefit from
Academy training. If a member does join the Academy in this manner, he
must drop all of his mainstream ships. No member can be forced to join
the Academy.

Departing From the Academy Fleet
================================

There are three ways a Cadet can leave the Academy Fleet.

1.  Graduation from the Academy.

2.  Departure from the Academy prior to graduation.

3.  Removal from the Academy by the Academy Commandant.

Disputes
========

Any dispute involving the Academy shall be moderated by the Academy
Commandant. Should any of the involved parties be the Academy
Commandant, the dispute shall be moderated by the Vice Commandant.
Should the dispute involve the Academy Commandant and Vice Commandant,
the dispute shall be moderated by the President.
