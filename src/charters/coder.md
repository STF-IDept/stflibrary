"CODE"
Establishment of the Coder
==========================

An Executive Assistant position is hereby created known as Coder.

The Coder is charged with the maintenance and development of STF's core
software and related software components by means of the authority in
this and subsequent edicts.

Appointment of the Coder
========================

The Coder shall be appointed by Presidential Edict with the prior
consent of the Internet Director. The Coder may not be removed or
replaced except with the joint-consent of the President and Internet
Director.

As an Executive Assistant position, the Coder is automatically retained
at the start of each Presidential Term. As an Executive Assistant
position, the Coder's direct superior is the President, not the Internet
Director.

Neither the President nor Internet Director may be appointed Coder
without the consent of the Vice President or Assistant Internet
Director, respectively. Should the Coder also be either the President or
Internet Director, the consent of the Vice President or Assistant
Internet Director, respectively, will be required for removal.

Should the author of the software be available and willing to accept the
position, he will be given preference in appointment. Other candidates
must be able to demonstrate an appropriate level of technical
proficiency with the software and programming languages involved, as
well as due regard for security and accessibility concerns.

Authority of the Coder
======================

The Coder shall:

-   Maintain, debug, and support STF's core software and related
    software components.

-   Develop and implement new features and upgrades to STF's core
    software as required, as needed, and as is found feasible in
    coordination with the Internet Department.

-   Make significant architectural changes to STF's core software,
    including replacement of the core software, with the prior consent
    of the President and Internet Director.

-   Ensure that the system is adequately documented for standard usage,
    administration, and maintenance.

The Internet Department must grant the Coder sufficient server access to
carry out his maintenance and development duties.

Should the Coder also be either President or Internet Director, the
consultation and approval of the Vice President or Assistant Internet
Director, respectively, shall be required.
